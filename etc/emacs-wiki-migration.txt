This document describes the process of migrating from emacs-wiki to Muse.

Features
========

Muse only
---------

 - Nested lists.

 - Publishing to other formats, such as LaTeX and Docbook.

 - Escaping special characters automatically throughout the entire
   document, so that you don't have to.

emacs-wiki only
---------------

The reason that most of these have not been implemented is lack of
demand.  If you want to see these features implemented, please send an
email to the muse-el-discuss mailing list, describing a good use case
for them.

 - Publishing bookmarks in XBEL format.  The bk2site program --
   available separately -- does an adequate job, so this was not
   implemented for Muse.

 - Macros, i.e. keywords like %this%, that expand to some text upon
   publishing.

 - Global IDs.

 - Menu generation.

 - PGP encryption of regions with the <gpg> and <gpge> tags.

 - The <redirect> tag.

 - Publishing of ChangeLog files.

 - The keybinding `C-c C-r': rename wiki link at point.

 - The keybinding `C-c C-D': delete wiki link at point.

 - The #style directive.

 - Using the title of the page in a generated index page, rather than
   the filename of the page.

Specifying Projects
===================

Special Topics
==============

Including multiple directories
------------------------------

With emacs-wiki, this was done by setting the
`emacs-wiki-recurse-directories' option to non-nil.

With Muse, this can be accomplished by including an entry in your
muse-project-alist setting that causes entries for a directory and all
subdirectories to be created.  This does not work when using the
customize interface to set `muse-project-alist'.

Here is an example:

    ("Blog" (,@(muse-project-alist-dirs "~/Blog")
             :default "index")

     ;; Publish this directory and its subdirectories.  Arguments
     ;; are as follows.  The above `muse-project-alist-dirs' part
     ;; is also needed, using Argument 1.
     ;;
     ;;  1. Source directory
     ;;  2. Output directory
     ;;  3. Publishing style
     ;;  remainder: Other things to put in every generated style
     ,@(muse-project-alist-styles "~/Blog"
                                  "~/public_html/blog"
                                  "blosxom"))

Generating an Index page
------------------------

In emacs-wiki, the page specified by `emacs-wiki-index-page' is an
automatically generated index page.

Muse does not automatically create this file.  If you want an
automatic index file to be generated, then create a file and place the
following contents (between the lines of underscores) in it.

_____
#title Index

<lisp>(muse-index-as-string t t t)</lisp>
_____

Then, add a :force-publish tag to the paths part of the project entry
in muse-project-alist.  Example:

    ("Website" ("~/Web/"
                :force-publish ("WikiIndex")
                :default "WelcomePage")
     (:base "xhtml"
            :base-url "http://mydomain.org/"
            :path "~/public_html"))
