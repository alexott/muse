This is the "Ideas" page for Emacs Muse.

It lists various ideas for future enhancements to Emacs Muse.  It also
serves to keep track of various changes that the maintainer would like
to merge into Muse at some point.

* Pending code

This is code that may or may not be already approved, but should be
checked out at some point.

** Waiting for a new release

 - Jim Ottaway
   - jeho-latex.el: a rewrite of muse-latex.el which should replace it
     at some point.
   - muse-latex-labels.el: addition of cross-references to LaTeX.
     Should be merged into muse-latex.el after replacing with
     jeho-latex.el.

 - David D. Smith
   - dds-emphasis-bits.el
     - New syntax for explicitly specifying emphasis:
       {[_-=*] some emphasized text}.
       Also, {** some text **} and {*** some text ***} should work.
     - Using -strike- to do strikethrough.

* Ideas without code

** After 3.10 release

None of these ideas has been finalized yet.

*** Support for different source markup formats

For any of these to be done, we have to figure out how to determine
which markup format to use, and parametrize the publishing functions
somewhat.

 - Markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

 - reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

 - Allow publishing in Org Mode's format, though this might not be
   needed now that org-publish.el exists.

 - Like Muse's default markup, but allow tags to be specified in
   Texinfo style: namely, "@tagname{contents}" instead of
   "<tagname>contents</tagname>" for small regions and
   "@tagname\ncontents\n@end tagname" for large regions.

 - Take markup features from phpBB and make a format out of it.  This
   could interest the forum crowd in our work.
