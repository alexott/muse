2006-03-10 16:26:53 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-51

    Summary:
      Make visiting of links a bit faster.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-51

    * lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-unhighlight-region): Remove muse-link
      property.
      (muse-link-properties): If we are highlighting a link, add the
      muse-link property.
    
    * lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-link-at-point): If the muse-link property
      exists at point, use it to bound the link.  Otherwise, use the old
      method.  This should make it easier to visit custom implicit link
      forms, since it does not require a change to muse-implicit-link-regexp.
    
    * lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-implicit-link-regexp): Note that this is not
      used when muse-colors.el is loaded.

2006-03-10 04:57:55 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-50

    Summary:
      Make resolving of inline image paths more flexible.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-50

    * lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-inline-image-method): Rename from
      `muse-inline-relative-to'.  Add muse-colors-use-publishing-directory
      option.  Make the fallback customization type a function rather than a
      symbol.
      (muse-colors-use-publishing-directory): New function that takes the
      best guess at where the current Muse file will be published and makes
      the given link relative to that.
      (muse-colors-insert-image): If muse-colors-inline-image-method is
      'default-directory, use the default directory.  If it is a function,
      call that function with LINK as an argument.  Otherwise, give up.

2006-03-10 03:43:03 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-49

    Summary:
      Fix inline image lockup.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-49

    * lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-explicit-link): Fix regression in
      patch-47.  This will prevent Muse from locking up after making a new
      inline image.

      Fix publishing problem with XEmacs.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-48

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-insert-file-or-string): Fix XEmacs
      publishing problem when text at beginning of buffer is read-only.
      Thanks to Christian Clercin for the report.

2006-03-06 06:06:38 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-47

    Summary:
      Get increase and decrease of list indentation to work with complex cases.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-47

    * lisp/muse-colors.el: Miscellaneous whitespace fixes.
      (muse-colors-explicit-link): Minor logic tweak.  The indentation seems
      to indicate this interpretation, though parens are different.
    
    * lisp/muse-mode.el: Miscellaneous whitespace fixes.
      (muse-alter-list-item-indentation): New function that alters the list
      structure at point.  The behavior to use is specified by the OPERATION
      argument.  Currently-supported operations are 'increase and 'decrease
      indentation level.  This now uses the same sort of list detection
      algorithm that is used during publishing, so it should work as expected
      for complicated cases.
      (muse-increase-list-item-indentation)
      (muse-decrease-list-item-indentation): Use
      `muse-alter-list-item-indentation'.

    Summary:
      Code simplification; improve muse-list-item-type function.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-46

    * lisp/muse.el (muse-list-item-type): Disambiguate between 'dl-term and
      'dl-entry, instead of just returning 'dl.
      (muse-forward-dl-term, muse-forward-dl-entry): Use
      muse-forward-list-item.
      (muse-forward-dl-part): Remove, merge functionality into
      muse-forward-list-item.
      (muse-forward-list-item): Add a few conditions needed for skipping
      nested 'dl-term and 'dl-entry items.

    Summary:
      Put movement by list and paragraph functions in muse.el.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-45

      (muse-forward-dl-term, muse-forward-dl-entry, muse-forward-dl-part):
      (muse-forward-list-item): Move here from muse-publish.el, so that
      muse-mode can make use of these.

    * lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-mode-map): Added key mappings to increase or
      decrease the current item indentation.
      (muse-get-paragraph-start): Helper function to determine the start of
      the current paragraph.
      (muse-insert-list-item): Cleaned up list item insertion code and made
      it handle definitions.
      (muse-increase-list-item-indentation): New interactive function to

2006-03-06 00:58:00 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-43

    Summary:
      Use slightly better algorithm for removing initial whitespace.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-43

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Keep track of whether
      the definition occurred on the same line as the term.
      (muse-publish-surround-text): Use a slightly better algorithm for
      removing initial indentation of list items.  This way, we preserve
      nesting of lists and also deal with same-level items that occur after
      nested items.  This probably doesn't make much of a difference in the
      output, but it should make support of nested definition lists a bit
      less troublesome in some cases.
      (muse-forward-dl-entry): Deal with ambiguity in muse-list-item-regexp
      regexp.
      (muse-forward-dl-part, muse-forward-list-item): Don't clobber match
      data.  Don't remove any text.  This makes the function easier to reuse
      in display-only situations.

2006-03-04 02:03:59 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-42

    Summary:
      In a preliminary way, make definition lists nest.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-42

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-forward-dl-part): Make it so that definition
      lists nest a bit better.
    
    * lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-dl-entry-regexp): Removed, since we don't
      use it anymore.

2006-03-03 19:28:22 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-41

    Summary:
      Fix nested list regression.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-41

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-text): Keep track of
      original indentation value and use that.  This fixes a regression
      caused by the last patch.

2006-03-03 05:24:59 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-40

    Summary:
      Make code look nicer by using muse-forward-dl-* functions.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-40

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Factor out lambda
      forms into muse-forward-dl-* for increased reusability.
      (muse-publish-surround-text): Call move function with an indent
      argument so that we don't have to use partial substitution in lambda
      forms.
      (muse-forward-dl-term): New function that moves forward to the next
      definition list term.
      (muse-forward-dl-entry): New function that moves forward to the next
      definition list entry.
      (muse-forward-dl-part): Renamed from `muse-forward-dl-item', since this
      does not move past entire definition list items, only parts of them.
      (muse-publish-markup-list, muse-publish-markup-quote):
      (muse-publish-quote-tag): Use better lambda form, and include a
      parameter.

2006-03-02 05:38:41 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-39

    Summary:
      Handle blockquoted sections within lists properly.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-39

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-forward-paragraph): Respect end-list
      property.  This should make blockquoted sections within a list do the
      right thing.
      (muse-forward-dl-item, muse-forward-list-item): Adjust logic for new
      behavior of `muse-forward-paragraph'.

    Summary:
      Fix problem when previous list item was nested.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-38

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-text): Bind nested list
      indicator at the correct place.  This fixes an error where a previous
      list was nested but the current one isn't.  Thanks to Per B. Sederberg
      for the report.

    Summary:
      Fix #5376: Changing muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp does not seem to affect anything.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-37

    * muse.texi (Implicit Links): Mention how to customize the WikiName
      recognition, and note that if you're setting this manually, you have to
      call some additional code.  This should fix #5376.  Also remove local
      variables section at end, since it seems pointless.

    Summary:
      Fix #5325: nested formatting not working in HTML output.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-36

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-word): Make nested emphasis
      work.  I'm a bit worried about possible double-escaping, though.
      Perhaps we should write the context to a text property and escape it
      later.  This should fix #5325.

2006-03-02 01:08:14 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-35

    Summary:
      Make paragraphs respect the end of a list or list item.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-35

    * lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-paragraph): If we are at the
      end of a list (or list item), back up.  This allows for a nice side
      effect when using indented sentences in between list items.
    
    * lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-paragraph): Ditto.
    
    * lisp/muse-xml.el (muse-xml-markup-paragraph): Ditto.
    
    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Make sure that end-ddt
      and end-item are marked up with end-list properties.

    Summary:
      Make sure an initial term exists before publishing definition list.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-34

    Summary:
      Add comments to nested list code.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-33

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl)
      (muse-publish-surround-text, muse-forward-dl-item):
      (muse-forward-list-item): Add comments, since there were many
      intricacies that are probably not obvious to the casual reader.
      (muse-forward-dl-item): Remove no-op condition.

2006-03-01 19:51:45 GMT	Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org>	patch-32

    Summary:
      Make nested list items work when separated by one blank line.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-32

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Use
      muse-forward-dl-item instead of muse-forward-list-item.  On second
      thought, don't unconditionally insert a newline, as that breaks some
      things.
      (muse-forward-dl-item): New function that moves forward to the next
      definition list item.  This was factored out from
      muse-forward-list-item, since it was getting too complex for my liking.
      (muse-forward-dl-item, muse-forward-list-item): Introduce concept of
      indented line, and skip past these if we have a blank line followed by
      an indented line.  "Indented" means "indented one past the current
      indentation level" here.  Remove some initial whitespace that was being
      overlooked before.

    Summary:
      Fix a couple of bugs in muse-wiki-resolve-project-page.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-31

    * lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-applicable-styles): Use a slightly
      better algorithm for adding styles to a list.
    
    * lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page): Handle project more
      carefully.  This should fix one or two hard-to-explain bugs.

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Move correctly to next
      line if definition is not on the same line as the term.
      (muse-forward-list-item): Fix publishing incorrectness that occurred
      when a non-dl list follows a definition list.  Always move to the right
      place so as to prevent extra empty dd elements from being published.

      Merge consecutive definition list terms properly.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-28

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-dl): Keep track of status
      correctly.  This makes Muse merge several definition list items into
      one list.
      (muse-forward-list-item): Use simpler regexp for 'dl.
    
    * lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-list-item-regexp): Make terms optional in
      definition lists, and make terms the 2nd matched text.

    Summary:
      Fix wrapped nested list item edge case.
    Revision:
      muse--main--1.0--patch-16

    * lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-regexps): Remove 2300 rule,
      since it is no longer needed.  Tweak 2200 regexp to cover 2300's use
      case.
      (muse-publish-surround-text): Tweak prefix for muse-list-item-regexp.
      (muse-list-item-type): Handle the new change to muse-list-item-regexp.
    
    * lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-list-item-regexp): Explicitly require
      exactly one space character in front of a unnumbered or numbered list.
      This should make it easier to match every list instance, since
      definition lists can now be handled more nicely in
      muse-publish-markup-regexps.  This also has the effect of fixing a
      wrapped nested list item edge case.

      (muse-journal-rss-munge-buffer): Display a warning if someone does not
      have "Page published by Emacs Muse (begins|ends) here" in their header
