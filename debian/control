Description: Maintain a local Wiki using Emacs-friendly markup
 Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
 simplifies the process of writings documents and publishing them to
 various output formats, such as DocBook, LaTeX, (X)HTML, TexInfo, and
 PDF.  It can even produce content suitable for blogging, such as
 Blosxom-style .txt files and RDF or RSS 2.0 feeds, using the
 muse-blosxom and muse-journal modules.
 .
 Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
 documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
 styles for generating different kinds of output.
 .
 This idea is not in any way new. Numerous systems exist - even one
 other for Emacs itself (Bhl Mode). What Muse adds to the picture is a
 more modular environment, with a rather simple core, in which
 "styles" are derived from to create new styles. Much of Muse's
 overall functionality is optional. For example, you can use the
 publisher without the major-mode, or the mode without doing any
 publishing; or if you don't load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those
 styles won't be available.
 .
 The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki version 2.44. The
 code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
 functions. The focus in this revision is on the authoring and
 publishing aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default
 behavior (available by loading the included muse-wiki
 module). CamelCase words are no longer special by default.
