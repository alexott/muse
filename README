This is the README file for Emacs Muse.

The terms "Emacs Muse", "Emacs-Muse", and "Muse" are used
interchangeably throughout this document to refer to this software.

Synopsis
========

Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
simplifies the process of writings documents and publishing them to
various output formats.

Emacs Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for
authoring documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of
publishing styles for generating different kinds of output.

Directory contents
==================

The directory structure is as follows.

etc :: Miscellaneous files like the emacs-wiki migration guide, the
  list of ideas for the future, and a RelaxNG schema for Muse XML.

contrib :: Files that are not a part of Muse proper, but are useful
  enough to be bundled with Muse.

examples :: Example configuration files for use with Muse, a
  publishable quickstart guide, and miscellaneous helper stuff.

experimental :: Source code that is not yet considered stable.

lisp :: Muse source code.

scripts :: Scripts that are used when compiling Muse and publishing
  the QuickStart document; they might prove useful if you want to
  automate the building of Muse documents.

texi :: The manual (muse.texi) and any supplemental sections.

Getting started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

You need either Emacs (21.1 or greater), XEmacs (21.4 or greater), or
SXEmacs (warning: Muse has not been tested with SXEmacs).  The current
maintainer recommends using Emacs.

Compilation
-----------

This is an optional step, since Emacs Lisp source code does not
necessarily have to be byte-compiled.  It may yield a slight speed
increase, however.

A working copy of Emacs or XEmacs is needed in order to compile the
Emacs Muse.  By default, the program that is installed with the name
`emacs' will be used.

If you want to use the `xemacs' binary to perform the compilation, you
must copy `Makefile.defs.default' to `Makefile.defs' in the top-level
directory, and then edit `Makefile.defs' as follows.  You can put
either a full path to an Emacs or XEmacs binary or just the command
name, as long as it is in the PATH.

EMACS    = xemacs
SITEFLAG = -no-site-file
# Edit the section as necessary
install_info = install-info --section "XEmacs 21.4" $(1).info \
        $(INFODIR)/dir || :

Running `make' in the top-level directory should compile the Muse
source files in the `lisp' directory, and generate an autoloads
file in `lisp/muse-autoloads.el'.

Installation
------------

Muse may be installed into your file hierarchy by doing the following.

Copy `Makefile.defs.default' to `Makefile.defs' in the top-level
directory, if you haven't done so already.  Then edit the
`Makefile.defs' file so that ELISPDIR points to where you want the
source and compiled Muse files to be installed and INFODIR indicates
where to put the Muse manual.  You may use a combination of DESTDIR
and PREFIX to further determine where the installed files should be
placed.  As mentioned earlier, you will want to edit EMACS and
SITEFLAG as shown in the Compilation section if you are using XEmacs.

If you are installing Muse on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you might
want to change the value of INSTALLINFO as specified in
`Makefile.defs'.

If you wish to install Muse to different locations than the defaults
specify, edit `Makefile.defs' accordingly.

Run `make' as a normal user, if you haven't done so already.

Run `make install' as the root user if you have chosen installation
locations that require this.

Insinuation
-----------

Two things need to happen in order for Muse to be usable with your
version of Emacs or XEmacs.

 1. The location of the Muse directory needs to be added to the load
    path so that your variant of Emacs can find it.

 2. You need to load whichever Muse files you wish to make use of.

A quick example that accomplishes both of these follows.

;; Add this to your .emacs or .xemacs/init.el file.
(setq load-path (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse"))
(require 'muse-mode)
(require 'muse-publish)
(require 'muse-html)  ;; and so on

Documentation
-------------

The Muse manual may be generated by running `make doc'.

It will produce two files: an Info file called `muse.info' and an HTML
document called `muse.html'.  Both of these will be created in the
`texi' directory.

This manual is also available online in several forms.

 - PDF: http://mwolson.org/static/doc/muse.pdf
 - HTML (single file): http://mwolson.org/static/doc/muse.html
 - HTML (multiple files): http://mwolson.org/static/doc/muse/

QuickStart
----------

Type "make examples" to generate a quickstart guide for Muse.  An HTML
document called QuickStart.html, an Info document called
QuickStart.info, and a PDF file called QuickStart.pdf will be created
in the `examples' directory.

If you do not have a working LaTeX installation with the proper fonts,
the PDF file will not be successfully generated.

To see the document that is interpreted in order to generate these
files, take a look at `examples/QuickStart.muse'.

To view the generated Info document from within Emacs, try the
following.

C-u M-x info RET /path/to/muse/examples/QuickStart.info RET
