This is the README file for the Emacs Muse.

The terms "the Emacs Muse", "Emacs Muse", and "Muse" are used
interchangeably throughout this document to refer to this software.

Synopsis
========

Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
simplifies the process of writings documents and publishing them to
various output formats.

Emacs Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for
authoring documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of
publishing styles for generating different kinds of output.

Directory contents
==================

The directory structure is as follows.

contrib :: Files that are not a part of Muse proper, but are useful
           enough to be bundled with Muse.

examples :: Example configuration files for use with Muse, a
            publishable quickstart guide, and miscellaneous helper
            stuff.

experimental :: Source code that is not yet considered stable.

lisp :: Muse source code.

scripts :: Scripts that are used when compiling Muse and publishing
           the QuickStart document; they might prove useful if you
           want to automate the building of Muse documents.

texi :: The manual (muse.texi) and any supplemental sections.

Getting started
===============

Compilation
-----------

This is an optional step, since Emacs Lisp source code does not
necessarily have to be byte-compiled.  It will yield a speed increase,
though.

A working copy of Emacs or XEmacs is needed in order to compile the
Emacs Muse.  By default, the program that is installed with the name
`emacs' will be used.

If you want to use the `xemacs' binary to perform the compilation, you
would need to edit `Makefile.defs' in the top-level directory as
follows.  You can put either a full path to an Emacs or XEmacs binary
or just the command name, as long as it is in the PATH.

EMACS    = xemacs
SITEFLAG = -no-site-file

Running `make' should compile the Muse source files in the `lisp'
directory.

Installation
------------

Muse may be installed into your file hierarchy by doing the following.

Edit the `Makefile.defs' file so that ELISPDIR points to where you
want the source and compiled Muse files to be installed and INFODIR
indicates where to put the Muse manual.  Of course, you will want to
edit EMACS and SITEFLAG as shown in the Compilation section if you are
using XEmacs.

If you are installing Muse on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you might
want to change the value of INSTALLINFO as specified in
`Makefile.defs'.

If you wish to install Muse to different locations than the defaults
specify, edit `Makefile.defs' accordingly.

Run `make' as a normal user.

Run `make install' as the root user if you have chosen installation
locations that require this.

Insinuation
-----------

Two things need to happen in order for Muse to be usable with your
version of Emacs or XEmacs.

 1. The location of the Muse directory needs to be added to the load
    path so that your variant of Emacs can find it.

 2. You need to load whichever Muse files you wish to make use of.

A quick example that accomplishes both of these follows.

;; Add this to your .emacs or .xemacs/init.el file.
(setq load-path (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse"))
(require 'muse-mode)
(require 'muse-publish)
(require 'muse-html)  ;; and so on

Documentation
-------------

The Muse manual may be generated by running `make doc'.

It will produce two files: an Info file called `muse.info' and an HTML
document called `muse.html'.  Both of these will be created in the
`texi' directory.

This manual is also available online in several forms.

 - PDF: http://www.mwolson.org/static/doc/muse.pdf
 - HTML (single file): http://www.mwolson.org/static/doc/muse.html
 - HTML (multiple files): http://www.mwolson.org/static/doc/muse/

QuickStart
----------

Type "make examples" to generate a quickstart guide for Muse.  An HTML
document called QuickStart.html, an Info document called
QuickStart.info, and a PDF file called QuickStart.pdf will be created
in the `examples' directory.

If you do not have a working LaTeX installation with the proper fonts,
the PDF file will not be successfully generated.

To see the document that is interpreted in order to generate these
files, take a look at `examples/QuickStart.muse'.

To view the generated Info document from within Emacs, try the
following.

C-u M-x info RET /path/to/muse/examples/QuickStart.info RET
