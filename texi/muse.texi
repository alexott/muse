@chapter What is Muse?

Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
simplifies the process of writing documents and publishing them to
various output formats.

Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
styles for generating different kinds of output.

This idea is not in any way new. Numerous systems exist -- even one
other for Emacs itself (Bhl Mode). What Muse adds to the picture is a
more modular environment, with a rather simple core, in which "styles"
are derived from to create new styles. Much of Muse's overall
functionality is optional. For example, you can use the publisher
without the major-mode, or the mode without doing any publishing; or if
you don't load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those styles won't be
available.

The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki.el version 2.44. The
code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
functions. The focus in this revision is on the authoring and publishing
aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default behavior
(available in the optional @file{muse-wiki} module). CamelCase words are
no longer special by default.

The Arch revision control system allows you to retrieve previous
versions and select specific features and bug fixes.  If you would like
to contribute to Muse development, it is highly recommended that you use
Arch, but this is not a requirement.

If you are new to Arch, you might find this tutorial helpful:

@node Installation, Getting Started, Obtaining Muse, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter Compiling and Installing Muse

Muse may be compiled and installed on your machine.

@subheading Compilation

This is an optional step, since Emacs Lisp source code does not
necessarily have to be byte-compiled.  It will yield a speed increase,
though.

A working copy of Emacs or XEmacs is needed in order to compile the
Emacs Muse.  By default, the program that is installed with the name
@command{emacs} will be used.

If you want to use the @command{xemacs} binary to perform the
compilation, you would need to edit @file{Makefile.defs} in the
top-level directory as follows.  You can put either a full path to an
Emacs or XEmacs binary or just the command name, as long as it is in the
@env{PATH}.

@example
EMACS    = xemacs
SITEFLAG = -no-site-file
@end example

Running @code{make} should compile the Muse source files in the
@file{lisp} directory.

@subheading Installation

Muse may be installed into your file hierarchy by doing the following.

Edit the @file{Makefile.defs} file so that @env{ELISPDIR} points to
where you want the source and compiled Muse files to be installed and
@env{INFODIR} indicates where to put the Muse manual.  Of course, you
will want to edit @env{EMACS} and @env{SITEFLAG} as shown in the
Compilation section if you are using XEmacs.

If you are installing Muse on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you might want
to change the value of @env{INSTALLINFO} as specified in
@file{Makefile.defs}.

If you wish to install Muse to different locations than the defaults
specify, edit @file{Makefile.defs} accordingly.

Run @code{make} as a normal user.

Run @code{make install} as the root user if you have chosen installation
locations that require this.


@node Getting Started, Projects, Installation, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter Getting Started
@cindex settings

To use Muse, add the directory containing its files to your
@code{load-path} variable, in your @file{.emacs} file.  Then, load in
the authoring mode, and the styles you wish to publish to.  An example
follows.

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path to Muse>")

(require 'muse-mode)     ; load authoring mode

(require 'muse-html)     ; load publishing styles I use
(require 'muse-latex)
(require 'muse-texinfo)
(require 'muse-docbook)
@end lisp

Once loaded, the command @kbd{M-x muse-publish-this-file} will publish
an input document to any available style.  If you enable
@file{muse-mode} within a buffer, by typing @kbd{M-x muse-mode}, this
command will be bound to @kbd{C-c C-t}.

If the currently opened file is part of a defined project in
@code{muse-project-alist}, it may be published using @kbd{C-c C-p}.

You should also type @kbd{M-x customize-group}, and give the name
@samp{muse}.  Each of the options has its own documentation.


@node Projects, Keystroke Summary, Getting Started, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter Creating and Managing Muse Projects
@cindex projects

Often you will want to publish all the files within a directory to a
particular set of output styles automatically.  To support, Muse
allows for the creations of "projects".  Here is a sample project, to
be defined in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(require 'muse-project)

(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("website"			; my various writings
         ("~/Pages" :default "index")
         (:base "html" :path "~/public_html")
         (:base "pdf" :path "~/public_html/pdf"))))
@end lisp

The above defines a project named "website", whose files are located
in the directory @file{~/Pages}.  The default page to visit is
@file{index}.  When this project is published, each page will be
output as HTML to the directory @file{~/public_html}, and as PDF to
the directory @file{~/public_html/pdf}.  Within any project page, you
may create a link to other pages using the syntax @samp{[[pagename]]}.

If you would like to include only some files from a directory in a Muse
project, you may use a regexp in place of @file{~/Pages} in the example.

By default, Muse expects all project files to have the file extension
@file{.muse}. Files without this extension will not be associated with
Muse mode and will not be considered part of any project, even if they
are within a project directory.

If you don't want to use @file{.muse}, you can customize the extension
by setting the value of @code{muse-file-extension}.

If you don't want to use any extension at all, and want Muse to
autodetect project files based on their location, then add the following
to your Muse settings file.

@lisp
(setq muse-file-extension nil
      muse-mode-auto-p t)
@end lisp

Note that if you chose to have @code{muse-file-extension} set to
@code{nil}, you may have trouble if your @file{.emacs} file or other
init scripts attempt to visit a Muse file.  (A very common example of
this is if you use Planner with Muse and run @code{(plan)} from your
@file{.emacs}.)  If you wish to visit Muse files from your
@file{.emacs}, be sure to also add the following additional code before
any such visits happen:

@lisp
(add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'muse-mode-maybe)
@end lisp

@node Markup Rules, Publishing Styles, Keystroke Summary, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter Rules for Using Markup
@cindex markup

A Muse document uses special, contextual markup rules to determine how
to format the output result.  For example, if a paragraph is indented,
Muse assumes it should be quoted.

There are not too many markup rules, and all of them strive to be as
simple as possible so that you can focus on document creation, rather
than formatting.

@section Paragraphs: centering and quoting
@cindex paragraphs

Paragraphs in Muse must be separated by a blank line.

@cindex paragraphs, centered
@subheading Centered paragraphs and quotations

A line that begins with six or more columns of whitespace (either tabs
or spaces) indicates a centered paragraph.  Alternatively, you can use
the @verb{|<center>|} tag to surround regions that are to be published as
centered paragraphs.

@cindex paragraphs, quoted
@cindex quotations
But if a line begins with whitespace, though less than six columns, it
indicates a quoted paragraph.  Alternatively, you can use the
@verb{|<quote>|} tag to surround regions that are to be published as
quoted paragraphs.

@cindex examples
@cindex monospace, rendering blocks
@cindex HTML, rendering blocks in monospace
@subheading Literal paragraphs

The @verb{|<example>|} tag is used for examples, where whitespace should
be preserved, the text rendered in monospace, and any characters special
to the output style escaped.

@cindex literal text
@cindex HTML, inserting a raw block
There is also the @verb{|<literal>|} tag, which causes a marked block to
be entirely left alone.  This can be used for inserting a hand-coded
HTML blocks into HTML output, for example.

@node Headings, Directives, Paragraphs, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Levels of headings
@cindex headings

A heading becomes a chapter or section in printed output -- depending on
the style.  To indicate a heading, start a new paragraph with one or
more asterices, followed by a space and the heading title.  Then begin
another paragraph to enter the text for that section.

All levels of headings will be published.  Most publishing styles only
distinguish the between the first 4 levels, however.

@example
* First level

** Second level

*** Third level

**** Fourth level
@end example

@node Directives, Emphasizing Text, Headings, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Directives at the beginning of a document
@cindex directives

Directives are lines beginning with the @samp{#} character that come
before any paragraphs or sections in the document.  Directives are of
the form ``#directive content of directive''.  You can use any
combination of uppercase and lowercase letters for directives, even if
the directive is not in the list below.

The @code{muse-publishing-directive} function may be used in header and
footer text to access directives.  For example, to access the
@samp{#title} directive, use @code{(muse-publishing-directive "title")}.

The following is a list of directives that Muse uses.

@table @code
@cindex #author
@item #author
The author of this document.

If this is not specified, Muse will attempt to figure it out from the
@code{user-full-name} variable.

@cindex #date
@item #date
The date that the document was last modified.

This is used by publishing styles that are able to embed the date
information.

@cindex #desc
@item #desc
A short description of this document.

This is used by the @code{journal} publishing style to embed information
inside of an RSS/RDF feed.

@cindex #title
@item #title
The title of this document.

If this is not specified, the name of the file is used.

@end table

@section Bold, italicized, and underlined text
@cindex emphasizing text
@cindex underlining text
@cindex italicizing text
@cindex verbatim text
@cindex monospace, rendering words

To emphasize text, surround it with certain specially recognized
characters.

@example
*emphasis*
**strong emphasis**
***very strong emphasis***
_underlined_
=verbatim and monospace=
@end example

@cindex WYSIWYG
While editing a Muse document in Muse mode, these forms of emphasis will
be highlighted in a WYSIWYG manner.  Each of these forms may span
multiple lines.

Verbatim text will be colored as gray by default.  To change this,
customize @code{muse-verbatim-face}.

You can also use the @verb{|<code>|} tag to indicate verbatim and
monospace text.  This is handy for regions that have an ``='' in them.

@node Footnotes, Verse, Emphasizing Text, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Making notes to be shown at the end
@cindex footnotes

A footnote reference is simply a number in square brackets.  To define
the footnote, place this definition at the bottom of your file.
@samp{footnote-mode} can be used to greatly facilitate the creation of
these kinds of footnotes.

Footnotes are defined by the same number in brackets occurring at the
beginning of a line.  Use footnote-mode's @kbd{C-c ! a} command, to very
easily insert footnotes while typing.  Use @kbd{C-x C-x} to return to
the point of insertion.

@node Verse, Lists, Footnotes, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Indicating poetic stanzas
@cindex verses
@cindex poetry

Poetry requires that whitespace be preserved, but without resorting to
monospace.  To indicate this, use the following markup, reminiscent of
email quotations.

@example
> A line of Emacs verse;
>   forgive its being so terse.
@end example

You can also use the @verb{|<verse>|} tag, if you prefer.

@example
<verse>
A line of Emacs verse;
  forgive its being so terse.
</verse>
@end example

@cindex verses, multiple stanzas
Multiple stanzas may be included in one set of @verb{|<verse>|} tags, as
follows.

@example
<verse>

A hyperlink can reference a URL, or another page within a Muse
project.  In addition, descriptive text can be specified, which should
be displayed rather than the link text in output styles that supports
link descriptions.  The syntax is as follows.

@example
[[link target][link description]]
[[link target without description]]
@end example

Thus, the current maintainer's homepage for Muse can be found
@samp{[[http://www.mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][here]]},

@cindex URLs
@cindex Email addresses

A URL or email address encountered in the input text is published as a
hyperlink.  These kind of links are called @dfn{implicit links} because
they are not separated from the rest of the Muse document in any way.

Some characters in URLs will prevent Muse from recognizing them as
implicit links. If you want to link to a URL containing spaces or any of
the characters ``][,"'`()<>^'', you will have to make the link
explicit. The punctuation characters ``.,;:'' are also not recognized as
part of a URL when they appear at its end. For information on how to
make an explicit link, see @ref{Explicit Links,,Hyperlinks and email
addresses with descriptions}.

@cindex WikiNames
If the @command{muse-wiki} module is loaded, another form of implicit
link will be made available.  WikiNames, which are typed in CamelCase,
are highlighted and published as links, provided that the file they
refer to exists.

Customization of WikiName recognition may be accomplished by editing the
@code{muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp} option and subsequently running
@code{(muse-configure-highlighting 'muse-colors-markupmuse-colors-markup)}.
If you use the Customize interface, the latter will be done
automatically.

@cindex InterWiki links
@cindex inter-project links
The @command{muse-wiki} module also allows for InterWiki links.  These
are similar to WikiWords, but they specify both the project and page of
a file.  The names of your project entries in @code{muse-project-alist}
will be used as InterWiki names by default.  Several examples follow.

@example
Blog::DocumentingMuse
Projects#EmacsMuse
Website
@end example

In the first case, the interwiki delimiter is @samp{::}, @samp{Blog} is
the project name, and @samp{DocumentingMuse} is the page name.  In the
second example, @samp{#} is the interwiki delimiter.  If the name of a
project occurs by itself in text, like the third case, it will be
colorized and published as a link to the default page of the given
project.

Customization of interwiki links may be accomplished by editing the
@code{muse-wiki-interwiki-alist} option.

Links to images may be used in either the target or the description, or

@end example

@cindex images, displaying
@cindex images, local
@subheading Displaying images in Muse mode
If a link to a locally-available image is encountered in the link
description, Muse mode will attempt to display it if your version of
Emacs permits this.

This behavior may be toggled with @kbd{C-c C-i}, or disabled permanently
by setting the @code{muse-colors-inline-images} option to @code{nil}.

The method for finding images may be altered by customizing the
@code{muse-colors-inline-image-method} option.  One useful value for
this option is @code{muse-colors-use-publishing-directory}, which tells
Muse mode to look in the directory where the current file will be
published.  The default is to look in the current directory.  Relative
paths like @samp{../pics/} should work for either setting.

Eventually, it is hoped that Muse will be able to copy images from the a
``source'' directory to a publishing directory by customizing
@code{muse-project-alist}, but this has not been implemented yet.

@cindex images, without descriptions
@cindex images, inlined
@subheading Publishing simple images
The following example will display correctly and publish correctly if a
@acronym{PNG} file called @file{TestLogo.png} exists in the
@file{../pics/} directory.  If text is on the same line as the picture,
it will remain so in the output.

@example
[[../myimage.png]]
@end example

@cindex images, captions
@subheading Publishing images with captions
If you want to add a caption to an image, use the following syntax.
This will center the image (if the output format supports it) and add a
centered caption below the picture.  Formats that do not support
centering the image will instead leave it against the left margin.

@example
[[../pics/mycat.png][My cat Dexter]]
@end example

Images with captions may only occur in their own paragraphs, with no
text on the same line.  Otherwise, the published output will not be
syntactically correct.

Arbitrary kinds of markup can be achieved using the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag,
which is the only Muse tag supported in a style's header and footer
text.  With the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag, you may generated whatever output
text you wish.  The inserted output will get marked up, if the
@verb{|<lisp>|} tag appears within the main text of the document.

@example
<lisp>(concat "This form gets " "inserted")</lisp>

@cindex lisp, and insert command
Note that you should not use the @code{insert} command within a set of

@cindex publishing, inserting files

Muse has several built-in tags that may prove useful during publishing.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-tags}, to see how to customize the tags that
Muse uses, as well as make your own tags.

@subheading Syntax

If a tag takes arguments, it will look like this, where ``tagname'' is
the name of the tag.

@example
<tagname arg1="string1" arg2="string2">
@end example

If you want the tag to look like it came straight from an XHTML
document, you can alternatively do the following.

@example
<tagname arg1="string1" arg2="string2" />
@end example

If a tag surrounds some text, it will look like this.

@example
<tagname>Some text</tagname>
@end example

If a tag surrounds a large region, it will look like this.

@example
<tagname>
Some text.
Some more text.
</tagname>
@end example

@subheading Tag listing

This is the complete list of tags that Muse accepts, including those
that were mentioned in previous sections.

@table @samp

@item <class>
If publishing to HTML, surround the given text with a @verb{|<span>|}
tag.  It takes one argument called ``name'' that specifies the class
attribute of the @verb{|<span>|} tag.

If publishing to a different format, do nothing extra to the text.

@item <code>
Treat the text surrounded by the tag as if they were enclosed in equal
signs, that is, make it monospace.

@item <command>
Run a command on the region, replacing the region with the result of the
command.  The command is specified with the ``interp'' argument.  If no
value for ``interp'' is given, pass the entire region to the shell.

The ``markup'' argument controls how this section is marked up.

If it is omitted, publish the region with the normal Muse rules.

If "nil", do not mark up the region at all, but prevent Muse from
further interpreting it.

If "example", treat the region as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<example>|} tag.

If "src", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<src>|} tag.  You should also specify the ``lang'' attribute if
doing this.

If "verse", treat the region as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<verse>|} tag, to preserve newlines.

Otherwise, it should be the name of a function to call, with the buffer
narrowed to the region.

@item <comment>
Treat the entire region as a comment.  If the option
@var{muse-publish-comments-p} is nil, delete the region, otherwise
publish it using the comment syntax of the current publishing style.

@item <contents>
Publish a Table of Contents.  This will either be inserted in-place or
at the beginning of the document, depending on your publishing style.
It does not have a delimiting tag.

By default, only 2 levels of headings will be included in the generated
Table of Contents.  To change this globally, customize the
@var{muse-publish-contents-depth} option.  To change this only for the
current tag, use the ``depth'' argument.

@item <example>
Publish the region in monospace, preserving the newlines in the region.
This is useful for snippets of code.

@item <include>
Insert the given file at the current location during publishing.  The
basic use of this tag is as follows, replacing ``included_file'' with
the name of the file that you want to include.

@example
<include file="included_file">
@end example

The ``markup'' argument controls how this section is marked up.

If it is omitted, publish the included text with the normal Muse
rules.

If "nil", do not mark up the included text at all.

If "example", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<example>|} tag.

If "src", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<src>|} tag.  You should also specify the ``lang'' attribute if
doing this.

If "verse", treat the included text as if it was surrounded by the
@verb{|<verse>|} tag, to preserve newlines.

Otherwise, it should be the name of a function to call after inserting
the file with the buffer narrowed to the section inserted.

@item <lisp>
Evaluate the Emacs Lisp expressions between the initial and ending tags.
The result is then inserted into the document, so you do not need to
explicitly call @code{insert}.  All text properties are removed from the
resulting text.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <literal>
Make sure that the text enclosed by this tag is published without
escaping it in any way.  This is useful for inserting markup directly
into the published document, when Muse does not provide the desired
functionality.

@item <markup>
Mark up the text between the initial and ending tags.  The markup
command to use may be specified by the ``function'' argument.  The
standard Muse markup routines are used by default if no ``function''
argument is provided.

This is useful for marking up regions in headers and footers.  One
example that comes to mind is generating a published index of all of the
files in the current project by doing the following.

@example
<markup><lisp>(muse-index-as-string t t)</lisp></markup>
@end example

@item <perl>
Run the @command{perl} language interpreter on the region, replacing the
region with the result of the command.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <python>
Run the @command{python} language interpreter on the region, replacing
the region with the result of the command.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <quote>
Publish the region as a blockquote.  This will either be inserted
in-place or at the beginning of the document, depending on your
publishing style.  It does not have a delimiting tag.

@item <ruby>
Run the @command{ruby} language interpreter on the region, replacing the
region with the result of the command.

This tag takes the ``markup'' argument.  See the description of
@verb{|<command>|} for details.

@item <src>
Publish the region using htmlize.
The language to use may be specified by the ``lang'' attribute.

Muse will look for a function named @var{lang}-mode, where @var{lang} is
the value of the ``lang'' attribute.

This tag requires htmlize 1.34 or later in order to work.  If this is
not satisfied, or the current publishing style is not HTML-based, Muse
will publish the region like an @verb{|<example>|} tag.

@item <verbatim>
This is used when you want to prevent Muse from trying to interpret some
markup.  Surround the markup in @verb{|<verbatim>|} and
@verb{|</verbatim>|}, and it will not be interpreted.

This tag was used often in previous versions of Muse because they did
not support whole-document escaping of specials.  Now, it will only be
needed for other tags, and perhaps footnotes as well.

@item <verse>
Preserve the newlines in the region.  In formats like HTML, newlines are
removed by default, hence the need for this tag.  In other publishing
styles, this tag may cause the text to be indented slightly in a way
that looks nice for poetry and prose.

@subsection Other tools needed for the Blosxom style

You will need to have @command{pyblosxom.cgi} or @command{blosxom.cgi}
installed on a machine that you have upload access to.

The following additional components are required in order to make the
date of blog entries display as something sensible.

@enumerate
@item
A script to gather date directives from the entire blog tree into a
single file.  The file must associate a blog entry with a date.

@item
A plugin for (py)blosxom that reads this file.
@end enumerate

These 2 things are provided for @command{pyblosxom.cgi} in the
@file{contrib/pyblosxom} subdirectory.  @file{getstamps.py} provides the
former service, while @file{hardcodedates.py} provides the latter
service.  Eventually it is hoped that a @command{blosxom.cgi} plugin and
script will be found/written.

Here is a sample listing from my @file{timestamps} file, which maps
each file to a date.  This can really be in any format, as long as your
date-gathering script and your plugin can both understand it.

@example
2005-04-01-14-16 personal/paper_cranes
2005-03-21 personal/spring_break_over
2004-10-24 personal/finished_free_culture
@end example

The script @file{contrib/pyblosxom/make-blog} demonstrates how to call
@file{getstamps.py}.  Note that you will need to set the current
directory to where your Muse files are, execute @file{getstamps.py}, and
then move the generated timestamps file to your publishing directory.

@subsection Format of a Blosxom entry and automation

Each Blosxom file must include `#date yyyy-mm-dd', or optionally the
longer `#date yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm', a title (using the #title directive),
plus whatever normal content is desired.

The date directive is not used directly by @command{pyblosxom.cgi} or
this program.  You need to have the two additional items from the former
section to make use of this feature.

There is a function called @code{muse-blosxom-new-entry} that will
automate the process of making a new blog entry.  To make use of it, do
the following.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Customize @code{muse-blosxom-base-directory} to the location that your
blog entries are stored.

@item
Assign the @code{muse-blosxom-new-entry} function to a key sequence.  I
use the following code to assign this function to @kbd{C-c p l'}.

@example
(global-set-key "\C-cpl" 'muse-blosxom-new-entry)
@end example

@item
You should create your directory structure ahead of time under your base
directory.  These directories, which correspond with category names, may
be nested.

@item
When you enter this key sequence, you will be prompted for the category
of your entry and its title.  Upon entering this information, a new file
will be created that corresponds with the title, but in lowercase
letters and having special characters converted to underscores.  The
title and date directives will be inserted automatically.

@section Publishing entries into a compilation

This publishing style is used to output ``books'' in LaTeX or PDF
format.

Each page will become a separate chapter in the book, unless the style
keyword @option{:nochapters} is used, in which case they are all run
together as if one giant chapter.

One way of publishing a book is to make a project for it, add the
project to @code{muse-project-alist}, and use the @code{book-pdf} style
with a very specific @code{:include} value to specify some page whose
contents will be checked for the values of @code{#title} and
@code{#date}, and whose name will be used in the output file.  Then to
publish the book, visit the aforementioned page and use @kbd{C-c C-t} or
@kbd{C-c C-p} to trigger the publishing process.  An example
@code{muse-project-alist} for this method follows.

@example
(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("MyNotes" (:nochapters t  ; do automatically add chapters
                    :book-chapter "Computer Science"
                    "~/Notes/cs"
                    :book-chapter "Mathematics"
                    "~/Notes/math"
                    :book-chapter "Emacs"
                    "~/Notes/emacs"
                    :book-end t ; the rest will not be placed in the book
                    "~/Notes"   ; so we can find the notes-anthology page
                    "~/Notes/private"
                    :force-publish ("index")
                    :default "index")
         (:base "book-pdf"
                :include "/notes-anthology[^/]*$"
                :path "~/public_html/notes")
         ;; other publishing styles for each directory go here,
         ;; if desired
         )))
@end example

In this example, there would be a file called
@file{~/Notes/notes-anthology.muse}, which would contain just the
following.  The resulting book would be published to
@file{~/public_html/notes/notes-anthology.pdf}.

@example
#title My Technology Ramblings
@end example

Another way is to call the @code{muse-book-publish-project} function
manually, with a custom project entry.  An example of this may be found
in John Wiegley's configuration file at
@file{examples/johnw/muse-init.el}, in the @code{muse-publish-my-books}

@section Keeping a journal or blog
@cindex journal
@cindex blog, journal style

The module facilitates the keeping and publication of a journal.  When
publishing to HTML, it assumes the form of a web log, or blog.

The input format for each entry is as follows.

@example
* 20040317: Title of entry

text for the entry.

<qotd>
"You know who you are. It comes down to a simple gut check: You
either love what you do or you don't. Period." -- P. Bronson
</qotd>
@end example

The "qotd", or Quote of the Day, is entirely optional.  When generated
to HTML, this entry is rendered as the following.

@example
<div class="entry">
  <div class="entry-qotd">
    <h3>Quote of the Day:</h3>
    <p>"You know who you are. It comes down to a simple gut
      check: You either love what you do or you don't. Period."
      -- P. Bronson</p>
  </div>
  <div class="entry-body">
    <div class="entry-head">
      <div class="entry-date">
        <span class="date">March 17, 2004</span>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-title">
        <h2>Title of entry</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p>Text for the entry.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
@end example

The plurality of "div" tags makes it possible to display the entries in
any form you wish, using a CSS style.

Also, an .RDF file can be generated from your journal by publishing it
with the "rdf" style.  It uses the first two sentences of the first
paragraph of each entry as its "description", and auto-generates tags
for linking to the various entries.

This publishing style is capable of producing LaTeX or PDF documents.

If you wish to publish PDF documents, you will need to have a good TeX
installation.  For Debian and Ubuntu, this can be accomplished by

work with documents published in both HTML and LaTeX, we need to
ignore the @verb{|<contents>|} tag.

and it will do what you expect.

@section Publish a poem to LaTex or PDF

The @code{muse-poem} module makes it easy to attractively publish and
reference poems in the following format, using the "memoir" module for
LaTeX publishing.  It will also markup poems for every other output
style, though none are nearly as pretty.

@example
Title


Body of poem


Annotations, history, notes, etc.
@end example

Once a poem is written in this format, just publish it to PDF using the
@code{poem-pdf} style.  To make an inlined reference to a poem that
you've written -- for example, from a blog page -- there is a "poem" tag
defined by this module.

@example
<poem title="name.of.poem.page">
@end example

Let's assume the template above was called @file{name.of.poem.page};
then the above tag would result in this inclusion.

@example
** Title

> Body of poem

John Wiegley uses this module for publishing all of the poems on his

@code{muse-publish-markup-regexps}

List of markup rules for publishing a page with Muse.

The rules given in this variable are invoked first, followed by whatever
rules are specified by the current style.

Each member of the list is either a function, or a list of the following
form.

@example
(REGEXP/SYMBOL TEXT-BEGIN-GROUP REPLACEMENT-TEXT/FUNCTION/SYMBOL)
@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item REGEXP
A regular expression, or symbol whose value is a regular expression,
which is searched for using `re-search-forward'.

@item TEXT-BEGIN-GROUP
The matching group within that regexp which denotes the beginning of the
actual text to be marked up.

@item REPLACEMENT-TEXT
A string that will be passed to `replace-match'.

If it is not a string, but a function, it will be called to determine
what the replacement text should be (it must return a string).  If it is
a symbol, the value of that symbol should be a string.
@end itemize

The replacements are done in order, one rule at a time.  Writing
the regular expressions can be a tricky business.  Note that case
is never ignored.  `case-fold-search' is always bound to nil
while processing the markup rules.

This is the order that the publishing rules are consulted, by default.
This may be changed by customizing @code{muse-publish-markup-regexps}.

@anchor{muse-publish-markup-tags}
@code{muse-publish-markup-tags}

A list of tag specifications, for specially marking up text.

XML-style tags are the best way to add custom markup to Muse.  This is
easily accomplished by customizing this list of markup tags.

For each entry, the name of the tag is given, whether it expects a
closing tag and/or an optional set of attributes, whether it is
nestable, and a function that performs whatever action is desired within
the delimited region.

The tags themselves are deleted during publishing, before the function
is called.  The function is called with three arguments, the beginning
and end of the region surrounded by the tags.  If properties are
allowed, they are passed as a third argument in the form of an alist.
The `end' argument to the function is always a marker.

Point is always at the beginning of the region within the tags, when the
function is called.  Wherever point is when the function finishes is
where tag markup will resume.

These tag rules are processed once at the beginning of markup, and once
at the end, to catch any tags which may have been inserted in-between.

@subsection Parameters used for defining styles
@cindex publishing, style elements

Style elements are tags that define a style.  Use
@code{muse-define-style} to create a new style.

@example
(muse-define-style DERIVED-NAME BASE-NAME STYLE-PARAMETERS)
@end example

@subheading Usable elements

@table @option

@item :suffix
File extension to use for publishing files with this style.

@item :link-suffix
File extension to use for publishing links to Muse files with this
style.

@item :osuffix
File extension to use for publishing second-stage files with this style.

For example, PDF publishing generates a LaTeX file first, then a PDF
from that LaTeX file.

@item :regexps
List of markup rules for publishing a page with Muse.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-regexps}.

@item :functions
An alist of style types to custom functions for that kind of text.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-functions}.

@item :strings
Strings used for marking up text with this style.

These cover the most basic kinds of markup, the handling of which
differs little between the various styles.

@item :tags
A list of tag specifications, used for handling extra tags.
@xref{muse-publish-markup-tags}.

@item :specials
A table of characters which must be represented specially.

@item :before
A function that is to be executed on the newly-created publishing buffer
(or the current region) before any publishing occurs.

This is used to set extra parameters that direct the publishing process.

@item :before-end
A function that is to be executed on the publishing buffer (or the
current region) immediately after applying all of the markup regexps.

This is used to fix the order of table elements (header, footer, body)
in XML-ish styles.

@item :after
A function that is to be executed on the publishing buffer after
:before-end, and immediately after inserting the header and footer.

This is used for generating the table of contents as well as setting the
file coding system.

@item :final
A function that is to be executed after saving the published file, but
while still in its buffer.

This is used for generating second-stage documents like PDF files from
just-published LaTeX files.

@item :header
Header used for publishing files of this style.

This may be a variable, text, or a filename.  It is inserted at the
beginning of a file, after evaluating the publishing markup.

@item :footer
Footer used for publishing files of this style.

This may be a variable, text, or a filename.  It is inserted at the end
of a file, after evaluating the publishing markup.

@item :style-sheet
Style sheet used for publishing files of this style.

This may be a variable or text.  It is used in the header of HTML and
XHTML based publishing styles.

@item :browser
The function used to browse the published result of files of this style.

@section Deriving a new style from an existing one
@cindex publishing styles, deriving

To create a new style from an existing one, use @code{muse-derive-style}
as follows.  This is a good way to fix something you don't like about a
particular publishing style, or to personalize it.

@example
(muse-derive-style DERIVED-NAME BASE-NAME STYLE-PARAMETERS)
@end example

The derived name is a string defining the new style, such as "my-html".
The base name must identify an existing style, such as "html" -- if you
have loaded @file{muse-html}.  The style parameters are the same as
those used to create a style, except that they override whatever
definitions exist in the base style.  However, some definitions only
partially override.  The following parameters support partial
overriding.

@xref{Style Elements}, for a complete list of all parameters.

@table @option

@item :functions
If a markup function is not found in the derived style's function list,
the base style's function list will be queried.

@item :regexps
All regexps in the current style and the base style(s) will be used.

@item :strings
If a markup string is not found in the derived style's string list, the
base style's string list will be queried.

@cindex bugs, reporting

After you have read this guide, if you still have questions about
Muse, or if you have bugs to report, there are several places you can
go.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@uref{http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsMuse} is the
emacswiki.org page, and anyone may add tips, hints, or bug descriptions
to it.

@item
@uref{http://www.mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html} is the web page
that Michael Olson (the current maintainer) made for Muse.

@item
Muse has four mailing lists.

@table @samp

@item muse-el-announce

@end table

@item
You can visit the IRC Freenode channel @samp{#emacs}. Many of the
contributors are frequently around and willing to answer your
questions.  The @samp{#muse} channel is also available for
Muse-specific help, and its current maintainer hangs out there.

@item
The maintainer of Emacs Muse, Michael Olson, may be contacted at
@email{mwolson@@gnu.org}.  He can be rather slow at answering email, so
it is often better to use the muse-el-discuss mailing list.

@item 2004
John Wiegley started Muse upon realizing that EmacsWiki had some serious
limitations. Around February 2004, he started making "emacs-wiki version
3.00 APLHA", which eventually became known as Muse.

Most of those who frequent the emacs-wiki mailing list continued to use
emacs-wiki, mainly because Planner hasn't been ported over to it.

As of 2004-12-01, Michael Olson became the maintainer of Muse, as per
John Wiegley's request.

@item 2005
Michael Olson overhauled this document and added many new sections in
preparation for the first release of Muse (3.01).

The first draft of this document was taken from the emacs-wiki texinfo
manual.  Michael Olson adapted it for Muse and added most of its
content.

John Sullivan did a majority of the work on the emacs-wiki texinfo
manual.

While Sacha Chua maintained emacs-wiki, she worked quite a bit on the
emacs-wiki texinfo manual.
