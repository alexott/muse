	* contrib/ikiwiki/Ikiwiki/Plugin/muse.pm: Move here from
	examples/ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin/muse.pm.

	* contrib/Makefile (htmlize-hack.elc): Don't byte-compile
	htmlize-hack.el, since it is only useful if htmlize.el is
	installed.

	* contrib/cgi.el: Add compatibility functions for calendar, so
	that it works with both Emacs 21 and Emacs 23.  Thanks to Brent
	Goodrick for the report.

	* texi/muse.texi (Using Muse Mode): Fix typo.
