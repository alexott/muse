2008-04-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.defs.default (DEBNAME, LASTUPLOAD, BUILDOPTS)
	(DISTRIBUTOR): Remove obsolete variables.

	* Makefile (debclean, debprepare, debbuild, debinstall, deb):
	Remove obsolete targets.

2008-03-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-make-faces-default): Improve docstring
	for muse-header-{1-3} faces.

2008-03-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-publish-this-file): Make sure
	that we follow the same rules as muse-project-publish-file,
	including creating the publishing directory if it does not exist.
	Thanks to Peter Jones for the report and initial patch.

2008-03-25  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-current-project-global): New variable
	that saves the value of muse-current-project across temporary
	buffers when publishing.
	(muse-project-publish-this-file, muse-project-publish): Save
	muse-current-project.
	(muse-project-save-buffers): Save the current buffer, so that this
	does not throw off publishing.
	(muse-project-set-variables): Set muse-current-project if it is
	nil and there is a saved value for it.  Thanks to Peter Jones for
	the report.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-batch-publishing-p)
	(muse-publishing-p): Docfix.
	(muse-inhibit-before-publish-hook): New variable that indicates
	whether muse-before-publish-hook should be inhibited.
	(muse-publish-markup-buffer): Use it.
	(muse-publish-file): Call muse-before-publish-hook here, so that
	we can run it before checking for file-local variables, since
	values set by the latter should overlay values set by the former.
	Bind muse-inhibit-before-publish-hook to t so that we do not call
	the hook twice.

2008-03-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-html-munge-buffer)
	(muse-journal-latex-munge-buffer, muse-journal-rss-munge-buffer):
	Use nil instead of current-time-zone to fix a bug where dates
	could be interpreted incorrectly.  We don't allow the user to
	specify the hour or minute, so it does not make sense to take the
	current time zone into account.  Thanks to Xin Shi for the report.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup): When point is on a
	read-only character, skip to the next non-read-only character.
	This works around a weird edge case with the table-el rule, and
	seems like a good thing to do in general.  Thanks to Suno Ano for
	the report.
	(muse-publish-table-el-table): Only proceed with table generation
	if we have located a non-read-only "|" character.

2008-02-23  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-project-files-with-spaces): Fix
	bug.

2008-02-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-read-project-file): Delete duplicates
	before calling muse-completing-read-function, since
	ido-completing-read does not do this.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-delete-dups): New compatibility function.

2008-02-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-src-allowed-modes): New option that
	specifies the modes that we permit the <src> tag to colorize.
	(muse-html-src-tag): Use it.  Use intern-soft instead of intern.

	(muse-publish-math-tag):
	* lisp/muse-poem.el (muse-poem-markup-tag):

	(muse-publish-perl-tag, muse-publish-php-tag)
	(muse-publish-python-tag, muse-publish-ruby-tag)
	(muse-publish-include-tag, muse-publish-mark-up-tag): Mark these
	tags as potentially dangerous for text written by untrusted
	contributors.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-mark-up-tag): Use intern-soft
	instead of intern.
	(muse-publish-enable-dangerous-tags): New option that determines
	whether to publish tags that can call external programs or expose
	sensitive information.  This is useful to set to nil for
	publishing files from untrusted sources.

2008-02-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-enable-local-variables): New
	option that determines whether to interpret local variables when
	publishing.  The default is not to do so.
	(muse-publish-file): Interpret local variables if the user wants
	this.  Thanks to Sebastian Tennant for the idea.

	* texi/muse.texi (Extending Muse): Flatten nodes by removing
	Common Elements and grouping its subsections under this chapter.
	(Style Elements): Use @defun.  Fix arguments to muse-define-style.
	Thanks to Sebastian Tennant for the report.  Explain the arguments
	of the function for :final.
	(Deriving Styles): Use @defun.  Fix argument names.
	(Embedded Lisp): Drop mention of this being the only tag allowed
	in headers and footers.  Thanks to Phillip Lord for the
	suggestion.
	(Tag Summary): Mention muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags.

2008-02-02  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.defs.default (INFODIR): Place files in .../share/info,

2008-01-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	for line-break.

	recognized.  Thanks to Mirko Vukovic and ktneely for the report.

2008-01-23  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-header)
	(muse-latex-slides-header, muse-latex-lecture-notes-header):
	Default to using UTF-8, rather than latin1.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-url): Add comments.  Move
	target detection higher.  Use unescaped description for image

2008-01-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>
