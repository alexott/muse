2007-01-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el (muse-publish-latex-tag)
	(muse-publish-math-tag): Publish region read-only when current
	style is Latex-derived, so that Muse does not escape it.
	(muse-publish-math-tag): If 6 or more spaces come before the tag,
	surround the region with "$$" rather than "$".  This is the Muse
	syntax for something centered, so it should be a good fit.

2007-01-15  Valery V. Vorotyntsev  <valery.vv@gmail.com>

	* lisp/muse-protocols.el (muse-url-protocols): Add "woman://"
	protocol.

	simpler when the section is left inside parentheses.
	(muse-browse-url-woman): New function.

2007-01-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* AUTHORS: Bookkeeping.

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el: Associate <math> tag with
	muse-publish-math-tag, not muse-publish-latex-tag.  Thanks to Jody
	Klymak for the report.
	(muse-publish-math-tag): Use muse-insert-markup for the "$"
	characters, so they don't get escaped.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-derived-p-1): New function to
	make muse-style-derived-p easier to implement.
	(muse-style-derived-p): If the style is not provided, fetch it and
	check to see if the car is a string.  This should fix the other
	problem that was reported.

	* texi/muse.texi (Projects): Apply patch from Bradley M. Kuhn that
	explains a case where setting muse-file-extension to nil can cause
	unexpected behavior.

2007-01-09  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-regexps): Make
	comments higher priority than tags.  Thanks to Stefan van der Walt
	for the report.

2007-01-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-markup-tag-info): Use the given
	argument rather than calling match-string.  Thanks to Stefan van
	der Walt for the report.  This should fix a bug with publishing
	<include file="..." markup="example">.

2007-01-06  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (debclean): New rule split from debrevision and
	debrelease.
	(debbuild): Take distributor into account.

	* Makefile.defs (DISTRIBUTOR): New field that tracks what
	vendor/distributor we are building for.

2007-01-04  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-src-tag): Remove initial blank
	line.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tags): Make "src"
	point to muse-publish-src-tag by default, since <src> and
	<example> have different parameters.
	(muse-publish-src-tag): New barebones publishing function for
	<src>, which is superseded when publishing in an HTML-based style.

2007-01-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-src-tag): Document.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-call-tag-on-buffer): New
	command that calls a given tag on the current buffer.  Attributes
	may be passed.
	(muse-publish-examplify-buffer, muse-publish-versify-buffer): Use
	it.
	(muse-publish-srcify-buffer): New function that allows
	markup="src" in the <include> tag.
	(muse-publish-get-and-delete-attr): New macro that gets an
	attribute from a list and removes the first instance of that
	attribute from said list.
	(muse-publish-markup-attribute): Handle markup="src".
	(muse-publish-command-tag, muse-publish-include-tag): Use
	muse-publish-get-and-delete-attr.  This allows the remaining
	attributes to be passed.

	as changes to <command> and <include>.

2006-12-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Update.

	* experimental/muse-mathml.el (muse-publish-mathml-tag): Rename
	from muse-publish-math-tag to avoid conflict with
	muse-latex2png.el.

2006-12-23  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el: Update header, since this has been
	rewritten sufficiently to not need an assignment from the original
	author.
	(muse-latex2png-use-xhtml): Remove, since we now autodetect this.
	(muse-latex2png): Use two underscores to separate prefix and hash.
	(muse-latex2png-region): New function split from
	muse-publish-latex-tag that can be used easily by other code.
	Detect whether we are using an HTML-based publishing style, and
	insert a simpler markup if we are not.  If we are using a
	Latex-based publishing style, do not generate an image, and leave
	the region alone.  Return the path of the generated image, in case
	other functions want to use this programmatically.
	(muse-publish-latex-tag): Set a default prefix based on the name
	of the current file.
	(muse-publish-math-tag): New tag that surrounds the region with
	"$" characters, so that it becomes a Latex math region, and then
	publishes it.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-derived-p): New function that
	returns non-nil if a given style, or the current style if omitted,
	is equal to or derived from the given base style.  This is useful
	in <lisp> tags, because it allows the user to specify markup that
	is only to be inserted for one particular style.

2006-12-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-tags): Add <src> tag.
	(muse-html-src-tag): New function which publishes the <src> tag.
	Thanks to Clinton Ebadi and Charles Wang for the initial
	implementations.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tags): Add <src> tag.

2006-12-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	muse-derive-style usage.  Rename to muse-init.el.

	* examples/mwolson/muse-init.el: Update.

	* lisp/muse-book.el (muse-book-publish): New function split from
	muse-book-publish-project.  This is used in the definitions for
	the book-latex and book-pdf styles.
	(muse-book-publish-p): New function split from muse-book-publish.
	(muse-book-get-directives): New function that retrieves the
	publishing directives from the given file.

	if no title was specified.

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project): Add :publish-project entry
	to widget.
	(muse-read-project, muse-project-find-file): Message fix.
	(muse-project-publish-file-default): New function split from
	muse-project-publish-file.
	(muse-project-publish-file): Allow file-level publishing function
	to be specified by the :publish element.  The default is
	muse-project-publish-file-default.
	(muse-project-publish-default): New function split from
	muse-project-publish.
	(muse-project-publish): Allow project-level publishing function to
	be specified by :publish-project element.  The default is
	muse-project-publish-default.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-file): Message fix.

	* texi/muse.texi (Book): Mention new way to publish books and
	provide an example, since the process may be non-obvious.

2006-12-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-munge-buffer): Split out
	content-modifying code from the rest of
	muse-docbook-finalize-buffer.

	* lisp/muse-groff.el (muse-groff-munge-buffer): Rename from
	muse-groff-finalize-buffer, since it adds content to the buffer.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-munge-buffer): Split out
	content-modifying code from the rest of muse-html-finalize-buffer.
	This fixes a bug when using <include> with <content> tags.

	* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-html-munge-buffer)
	(muse-journal-latex-munge-buffer)
	(muse-journal-rss-munge-buffer): Rename, since they add content to
	the buffer.

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-munge-buffer): Rename from
	muse-latex-finalize-buffer, since it adds content to the buffer.

	* lisp/muse-mode.el:
	* lisp/muse-project.el:
	* lisp/muse-publish.el:
	* lisp/muse.el: Fix recursive load error.

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-munge-buffer): Rename from
	muse-texinfo-finalize-buffer, since it adds content to the buffer.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el: Comment cleanup.

	* lisp/muse-xml.el (muse-xml-charset-default): Docfix.

2006-12-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-header, muse-latexcjk-header):
	Remove the definition of \comment, since Latex already has comment
	syntax.
	(muse-latex-markup-strings): Use the Latex comment syntax, rather
	than our own.  Thanks to Ryan Stutsman for pointing this out.

2006-12-02  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-insert-contents): Tweak regexp so
	that this can generate a proper table of contents for Planner HTML
	publishing.

2006-12-01  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-replace-regexp-in-string): In case someone is
	using a very old Emacs, avoid an infinite loop that could occur
	when the regexp is an empty string.

2006-11-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Bring up to date.

	* lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-paragraph): Fix nested
	list issues and multiple-stanza verse issues.  This takes care of
	all of the markup issues I was worried about.

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-ignore-regexp): Minor docfix.
	(muse-project-publish-private-files): New option that indicates
	whether files with private filesystem permissions should be
	published.  The default is to publish them, since it avoids
	confusion in new users.
	(muse-project-private-p): Use it.

2006-11-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-resolve-link): If no remote
	style is found, which means that the link is not a Muse page, do
	not add a suffix or prefix to it.  This should fix the
	"[[thing.owl]]" bug that Phillip Lord reported.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-link-file): Simplify by
	removing unused 2nd argument.

2006-11-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-text): Fix bug in
	latex publishing where nested enumerated lists would be squashed
	together at the end.

2006-11-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-markup-strings): Make an ordered
	list embedded in a definition list look right.  This also allows
	for definitions to be separated from their terms, much like the
	way HTML does it by default, if the user puts a blank line or a
	line break between the term and the definition.  If the term and
	definition are on the same line, they will be that way in the
	output as well.

2006-11-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* muse.texi (Markup Strings): Fix typo.  Thanks to Haiyong Zheng
	for the report.

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-find-file): Fix bug when
	following a relative link worked even when the path was incorrect.

2006-11-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-mode-map): Remove C-c C-c binding for
	muse-follow-name-at-point to reduce collisions with other
	modes (Planner).

	* muse.texi (Keystroke Summary): Remove C-c C-c binding.

2006-11-04  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): Make page
	optional, and make interwiki delimiter a regular rather than shy
	group.
	(muse-wiki-handle-implicit-interwiki): Rename from
	muse-wiki-handle-interwiki.  Use match group 3 to get the page.
	(muse-wiki-handle-explicit-interwiki): New function that is
	smarter about where an explicit link ends in a buffer.  This
	allows you to refer to page names with invalid Wiki characters,
	such as underscores and dashes, merely by enclosing them in double
	brackets.  Also, a bug with recognizing project names too loosely
	has been fixed.

2006-11-03  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-page-file): Make relative
	links work as expected, hopefully.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-this-file): Set the current
	output style manually, since it will differ from anything in the
	publishing style list.

2006-10-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-markup): Remove note about
	grouping elements, since that no longer applies.
	(muse-colors-custom-tags): Explicitly match against
	muse-tag-regexp to get the match-data set the way we want.  This
	really fixes the <example> highlighting bug that Stefan reported.
	(muse-configure-highlighting): Set the original value to the
	symbol, not the modified value.  Re-use modified rules properly.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): Fix bug
	introduced yesterday.

2006-10-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* examples/mwolson: Update my example configuration.

	* NEWS: Update.

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-configure-highlighting): Remove rules
	without a regexp in the first position before iterating through
	them to build muse-colors-vector.  This fixes a bug with the
	display of <example> tags.  Thanks to Stefan Reichör for the
	report.

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-find-file): Permit non-Muse
	files in projects to be linked to.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-url): Allow the original link
	to serve as a description for a URL, as long as it differs from
	the destination URL.  This fixes the description of WikPage links
	in PDF output.
	(muse-publish-link-file): Check to see whether the given link
	points at a valid file.  If so, return it.  Otherwise, apply other
	transforms like prefix and link suffix.

	* lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-file-regexp): If something ends in
	"/", it is a file or directory, not a Muse page.  Thanks to
	Phillip Lord for the suggestion.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page): Use the path
	of the current page as the local path, instead of duplicating the
	remote file's path.  This probably fixes at least one reported
	bug. since it's quite major.
	(muse-wiki-update-project-file-regexp)
	(muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): Ensure that nil is never
	passed to regexp-opt, since that can cause Emacs 21 to throw an
	"maximum binding depth exceeded" error.  Thanks to xs32 AT cornell
	DOT edu for the report.
	(muse-wiki-handle-wikiword): Avoid a potential stringp error.

2006-10-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-choose-style-by-link-suffix)
	(muse-project-resolve-link): If the given style does not have a
	link-suffix, default to suffix.  This fixes a bug I was noticing
	when linking to a file that was published in both PDF and HTML
	form.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-determine-dl-indent): New
	function that is used as a callback to determine the initial
	amount of indentation that the current dl item has.
	(muse-publish-surround-dl): Use it.  Pass the initial indent value
	and the post-indent value, instead of trying to determine them
	both.
	(muse-publish-strip-list-indentation): New function stripped from
	`muse-publish-surround-text' for readability.
	(muse-publish-surround-text): Instead of taking a determine-indent
	value, take a determine-indent-func function, which is called just
	after finding the next list item.  If we are asked to determine
	the amount of indentation, concatenate indent and post-indent the
	first time around.  This effectively fixes all known definition
	list issues.

2006-10-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse.el: Provide the 'muse-nested-tags feature so that
	other software -- namely, Planner -- can detect whether they are
	using a version of Muse that supports nested tags.
	(muse-goto-tag-end): Moved from muse-publish.el and renamed from
	muse-publish-goto-tag-end.

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-tags, muse-colors-custom-tags):
	Adapt for nested tags.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-tags): Indicate that the
	<class> tag is nestable.  Thanks to Phillip Lord for noticing
	this.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tag)
	(muse-publish-quote-tag): Use muse-goto-tag-end.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el ("muse-colors"): Adapt for nested tags.

	the suggestion.

	* lisp/muse-poem.el (muse-poem-tag): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tags)
	(muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags): Shift 4th element to 5th
	element and make 4th element determine whether tags are nestable.
	(muse-publish-goto-tag-end): New function that moves to the end of
	a tag.  Handle nested tags when NESTED is non-nil.
	(muse-publish-markup-tag): Call muse-publish-goto-tag-end.  Use
	5th element for function.
	(muse-publish-quote-tag): Handle nested quote tags.  I've tested
	this on several scenarios, and it seems to work.
	(muse-publish-surround-text): Accept new optional argument
	LIST-ITEM which determines the regexp to use for list items.  The
	default is to use muse-list-item-regexp.

	* muse.texi (Markup Tags): Mention nestable tags.

	* NEWS: Mention new files.

2006-10-15  Elena Pomohaci  <e.pomohaci@gmail.com>

	which characters can prevent Muse from recognizing something as an
	implicit link.

	* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-next-reference)
	(muse-previous-reference): Fix bug #6367 by moving point to the
	beginning of the link.

2006-09-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-use-font-lock): Don't quote

	recent Emacs 22 builds.

	* lisp/muse-backlink.el: Wrap muse-backlink-split-string in an
	eval-and-compile block to avoid a compiler warning.

2006-09-25  Jim Ottaway  <j.ottaway@lse.ac.uk>

	processing.
	(muse-texinfo-markup-heading): Use muse-texinfo-protect-wikiwords.

2006-09-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-markup-heading): New function
	adopted from Jim Ottaway's patch.  It removes links from the
	heading, and then marks the region read-only to inhibit WikiWord
	detection.

	muse-el-internationalization mailing list.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-path-sans-extension): New function that acts

	investigating this.

	muse-path-sans-extension instead of file-name-sans-extension.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-file, muse-publish-url):
	Ditto.

	contrib/pyblosxom/getstamps.py: Update version and headers.

2006-08-27  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-configure-highlighting): Prune out any
	nil values before they get to mapconcat.  This fixes a lockup when
	muse-wiki-match-all-project-files is nil.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-match-all-project-files)
	(muse-wiki-ignore-implicit-links-to-current-page)
	(muse-wiki-interwiki-regexp, muse-wiki-interwiki-alist)
	(muse-wiki-resolve-project-page, muse-wiki-handle-interwiki)

	(muse-wiki-publish-pretty-title): Docfix.
	(muse-wiki-update-local-wikiword-regexp): Rename from
	muse-wiki-update-local-wikiword-regexp.  Set
	muse-wiki-project-file-regexp instead of
	muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp, as suggested by Per Sederberg.  Don't
	take muse-wiki-use-wikiword into account, since this is a
	different concept now.
	(muse-wiki-update-wikiword-regexp): Remove.
	(muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp): In-line the :set function.
	(muse-wiki-handle-wikiword): Use muse-wiki-project-file-regexp.

2006-08-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-text): When looking
	for indented list items, ignore blank lines.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-update-local-wikiword-regexp)
	(muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): Use regexp-opt instead of
	mapconcat.  This should hopefully fix a problem with large amounts
	of files with spaces in their name.  Thanks to Greg Detre for the
	report.

2006-08-24  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-new-entry): Remove the
	numbers from the argument to format-time-string.  This fixes an
	XEmacs bug.  Thanks to Michael Welle for the report and analysis.

2006-08-18  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-file-entries): Since we are
	given a full path, match against the filename as well.  This fixes
	an issue where backup files were being added to the file alist.

	* lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-regexps): Apply a fix
	from muse-html.el.

2006-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (.PHONY): Don't use line continuations.
	(realclean fullclean): Call realclean in subdirs, not distclean.
	(distclean): Don't call realclean, since this would wipe out our
	autoloads file.
	(dist): Use correct path to autoloads file.

	* NEWS: Catch up with the latest changes.

	* experimental/Makefile (.PHONY): Wrap long line.

	* lisp/Makefile (distclean): Do the same thing as "clean", not
	"realclean".

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-get-applicable-style):
	Indentation tweak.
	(muse-project-ignore-regexp, muse-project-recurse-directory):
	Docfix.
	(muse-project-of-file): Try the ignored files regexp against the
	base filename as well as the entire path.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-this-file): Display message
	if the buffer is not associated with any file, so that we avoid
	errors later on.
	(muse-publish-url-desc): New function taken from muse-publish-url
	that causes a URL description to be transformed.
	(muse-publish-url): Call muse-publish-url-desc on either the
	description or the original URL if it will be used as a
	description.  Accept the original URL as an argument, in case it
	was transformed earlier.
	(muse-publish-insert-url): Pass original URL as an argument.
	(muse-publish-markup-link): Make this somewhat easier to follow.
	Pass original URL as argument.
	(muse-publish-get-style): If the same style is used to publish to
	two different directories, prompt the user for which directory to
	use.
	(muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags): Sync lisp tag with the
	latest changes.
	(muse-publish-markup-url): Pass original URL as an argument.  This
	fixes the "nil" description for bare URLs that was in 3.02.91.
	Nothing like finding a bug just after completing the announcement
	of a release.

	* lisp/muse.el: Use defalias whenever convenient.
	(muse-version): Set version to 3.02.92 (3.03 RC2).

2006-08-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-finalize-buffer): Since the html
	style does not derive from any other class, return `t' here.
	This, along with the corresponding change to muse-publish.el,
	fixes a problem with the table of contents getting inserted
	multiple times for custom html-based styles.
	(muse-html-markup-strings, muse-xhtml-markup-strings): Use a
	smarter method for table centering that works with XHTML.

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el Rename all functions to have a
	"muse-latex2png" prefix.  Turn all variables into customizable
	options in the muse-latex2png group.
	(muse-latex2png-img-dest): New option specifying where to place
	the images.
	(muse-latex2png-template): New option containing the template to
	use for the surrounding LaTeX code.
	(muse-latex2png-use-xhtml): New option that toggles strict XHTML
	compliance.
	(muse-latex2png-move2pubdir): Avoid multiple redundant error
	messages when something else goes wrong.  Create the image
	subdirectory if it doesn't exist already -- thanks to Christian
	Straßer for the report.  Expand the filename properly.
	(muse-publish-latex-tag, muse-latex2png): Ditto on error messages
	and filename expansion.
	(muse-latex2png): Use the "muse-latex2png" prefix by default.  Set
	the default directory properly.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-run-hooks): Make sure that we
	do not run the same function twice.

2006-08-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-explicit-link): Fix recently
	introduced wrong-type-argument error.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-strings)
	(muse-xhtml-markup-string): Cause table definition that contains
	image to be center-aligned.  This should fix an issue with images
	not being centered when captions are very long.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-table-fields): Trim
	whitespace from fields once we have split them up.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-trim-whitespace): New function that strips
	leading and trailing whitespace from a string.

2006-08-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Update through patch-95.

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-lisp-tag): Use a simpler regexp
	to match the tags.
	(muse-colors-explicit-link): Show images in link descriptions if
	inlined images are enabled.

	* lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-strings): Add
	definitions for 'image-with-desc, 'image, and 'image-link.
	(muse-docbook-markup-paragraph): If an inlined image begins a
	paragraph, insert <para> before it.
	(muse-docbook-fixup-images): New function that upper-cases the
	"format" attribute of the <imagedata> tag.
	(muse-docbook-finalize-buffer): Call it.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-strings): Publish images
	with descriptions as centered tables, with a centered caption
	underneath.  The resulting look is consistent with the way that
	they are published in the LaTeX style.  Thanks to Jody Klymak for
	the suggestion.
	(muse-xhtml-markup-strings): Ditto, but XHTML apparently has no
	valid way to center a table.
	(muse-html-markup-paragraph): Use class="image" instead of
	"image-link" for paragraphs that start with an embedded image.

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-markup-specials-url): Use
	\textbackslash{} for "\".  Thanks to Jim Ottaway for the
	suggestion.
	(muse-latex-markup-specials-image): New option that enables
	escaping of specials in images.  This was split from the URL
	specials.
	(muse-latex-decide-specials): Handle 'image context.
	(muse-latex-fixup-dquotes): Go to beginning of document, instead
	of relying on caller to do this for us.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-escape-specials): Document
	'image context.
	(muse-publish-url): Use 'image context for images.  Use 'image
	instead of 'image-link and 'image-link in place of
	'url-with-image.  Separate the image file from its extension so
	that docbook and texinfo can publish images correctly.
	(muse-publish-markup-link): Don't force a description if one is
	not given.  This fixes a bug where images without descriptions
	were being published as 'image-with-desc instead of 'image.

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-decide-specials): Treat
	images the same as URLs.
	(muse-texinfo-markup-strings): Improve image markup to achieve an
	effect similar to that of the LaTeX publishing style.  Simplify
	'url string.

	* lisp/muse-xml-common.el (muse-xml-decide-specials): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-replace-regexp-in-string): Save match data
	when we have to use the custom version of this function.

	* muse.texi (Images): Explain how to toggle inlining of images and
	give better examples.  Mention captions and that captioned images
	should not be used inside of text paragraphs.
	(Markup Strings): Bring up-to-date with the changes made since
	3.02.

2006-08-06  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-tags): Allow <lisp> to take
	attributes.
	(muse-colors-lisp-tag): Figure out where the <lisp> tag and its
	delimiter are instead of hard-coding it.

	* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-insert-thing): Qualify "tag".
	(muse-mode): Make filling definition lists work better.  This
	should fix #5359.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-run-hooks): Use
	`muse-style-element' instead of `muse-get-keyword' here.  This
	should fix #6399.
