2006-10-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* examples/mwolson: Update my example configuration.

	* NEWS: Update.

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-configure-highlighting): Remove rules
	without a regexp in the first position before iterating through
	them to build muse-colors-vector.  This fixes a bug with the
	display of <example> tags.  Thanks to Stefan Reichör for the
	report.

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-find-file): Permit non-Muse
	files in projects to be linked to, though it isn't yet sure
	whether they will publish correctly.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-url): Allow the original link
	to serve as a description for a URL, as long as it differs from
	the destination URL.  This fixes the description of WikPage links
	in PDF output.
	(muse-publish-link-file): Check to see whether the given link
	points at a valid file.  If so, return it.  Otherwise, apply other
	transforms like prefix and link suffix.

	* lisp/muse-regexps.el (muse-file-regexp): If something ends in
	"/", it is a file or directory, not a Muse page.  Thanks to
	Phillip Lord for the suggestion.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-resolve-project-page): Use the path
	of the current page as the local path, instead of duplicating the
	remote file's path.  This probably fixes at least one reported
	bug. since it's quite major.

2006-10-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-choose-style-by-link-suffix)
	(muse-project-resolve-link): If the given style does not have a
	link-suffix, default to suffix.  This fixes a bug I was noticing
	when linking to a file that was published in both PDF and HTML
	form.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-determine-dl-indent): New
	function that is used as a callback to determine the initial
	amount of indentation that the current dl item has.
	(muse-publish-surround-dl): Use it.  Pass the initial indent value
	and the post-indent value, instead of trying to determine them
	both.
	(muse-publish-strip-list-indentation): New function stripped from
	`muse-publish-surround-text' for readability.
	(muse-publish-surround-text): Instead of taking a determine-indent
	value, take a determine-indent-func function, which is called just
	after finding the next list item.  If we are asked to determine
	the amount of indentation, concatenate indent and post-indent the
	first time around.  This effectively fixes all known definition
	list issues.

2006-10-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse.el: Provide the 'muse-nested-tags feature so that
	other software -- namely, Planner -- can detect whether they are
	using a version of Muse that supports nested tags.
	(muse-goto-tag-end): Moved from muse-publish.el and renamed from
	muse-publish-goto-tag-end.

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-tags, muse-colors-custom-tags):
	Adapt for nested tags.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-tags): Indicate that the
	<class> tag is nestable.  Thanks to Phillip Lord for noticing
	this.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tag)
	(muse-publish-quote-tag): Use muse-goto-tag-end.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el ("muse-colors"): Adapt for nested tags.

2006-10-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* AUTHORS: Bookkeeping.

	* lisp/muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-header): Indent code in lisp
	tag.

	* lisp/muse-groff.el (muse-groff-markup-tags): Adapt for nested
	tags.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-tags): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse-import-docbook.el (muse-import-docbook)

	(muse-import-docbook-get-title): Remove cl.el-ism.

	* lisp/muse-import-xml.el (muse-import-xml): Fix compiler warning.

	* lisp/muse-journal.el (muse-journal-latex-markup-tags): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el (muse-publish-markup-tags): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-previous-reference): Minor docfix.
	(muse-next-reference, muse-previous-reference): Minor whitespace
	changes.
	(muse-mode-choose-mode): Add autoload cookie.  Thanks to Leo for
	the suggestion.

	* lisp/muse-poem.el (muse-poem-tag): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-markup-tags)
	(muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags): Shift 4th element to 5th
	element and make 4th element determine whether tags are nestable.
	(muse-publish-goto-tag-end): New function that moves to the end of
	a tag.  Handle nested tags when NESTED is non-nil.
	(muse-publish-markup-tag): Call muse-publish-goto-tag-end.  Use
	5th element for function.
	(muse-publish-quote-tag): Handle nested quote tags.  I've tested
	this on several scenarios, and it seems to work.
	(muse-publish-surround-text): Accept new optional argument
	LIST-ITEM which determines the regexp to use for list items.  The
	default is to use muse-list-item-regexp.

	* muse.texi (Markup Tags): Mention nestable tags.

	* NEWS: Mention new files.

2006-10-15  Elena Pomohaci  <e.pomohaci@gmail.com>

	* lisp/muse-import-docbook.el: New file that converts Docbook XML
	into Muse format.

	* lisp/muse-import-xml.el: New file that provides helper routines
	for converting XML-ish files to Muse format.

2006-10-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Update for 3.02.7 bugfix release.

	recognised URLs.

	* muse.texi: Clarify handling of implicit links by mentioning
	which characters can prevent Muse from recognizing something as an
	implicit link.

2006-09-26  Stefan Schlee  <stefan_schlee@yahoo.com>

	* lisp/muse-mode.el (muse-next-reference)
	(muse-previous-reference): Fix bug #6367 by moving point to the
	beginning of the link.

2006-09-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-use-font-lock): Don't quote
	beginning-of-line.  This should fix a bug that was noticed in
	recent Emacs 22 builds.

	* lisp/muse-backlink.el: Wrap muse-backlink-split-string in an
	eval-and-compile block to avoid a compiler warning.

2006-09-25  Jim Ottaway  <j.ottaway@lse.ac.uk>

	* lisp/muse-backlink.el (muse-backlink-split-string):
	Compatibility with Emacs versions < 22

	that backlinks are inserted at the right time.
	(muse-backlink-insert-hook-func): Remove unwind-protection; check
	for pending backlink, and that this is the targe page.
	(muse-backlink-handle-link): Don’t handle the link if we are
	already handling one. Return the link as well as the parent links.

2006-09-25  Sasha Kovar  <sasha@arcocene.org>

	* lisp/muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-new-entry): : Fix for bug
	#6942 - muse-blosxom-new-entry fails when using tags.

2006-09-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-protect-wikiwords): Silence
	compiler warning.

2006-09-14  Jim Ottaway  <j.ottaway@lse.ac.uk>

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-protect-wikiwords): New
	function: Protect all wikiwords from START to END from further
	processing.
	(muse-texinfo-markup-heading): Use muse-texinfo-protect-wikiwords.

2006-09-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-markup-heading): New function
	adopted from Jim Ottaway's patch.  It removes links from the
	heading, and then marks the region read-only to inhibit WikiWord
	detection.

2006-09-13  Jim Ottaway  <j.ottaway@lse.ac.uk>

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-markup-functions): Add
	special handling for headings.
	(muse-texinfo-remove-links): New function that removes explicit
	links from the given strings, replacing them with a description.

2006-09-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* muse.texi (Getting Help and Reporting Bugs): Mention the
	muse-el-internationalization mailing list.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-path-sans-extension): New function that acts
	like file-name-sans-extension, but guarantees to never modify the
	directory part of the path.  Thanks to Evan Monroig for
	investigating this.

	* lisp/muse-book.el (muse-book-publish-project): Use
	muse-path-sans-extension instead of file-name-sans-extension.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-file, muse-publish-url):
	Ditto.

2006-08-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* muse.texi (Blosxom Requirements): Fix typo.

	* contrib/pyblosxom/getstamps.py (recurse): Ignore metadata
	directories for bzr and darcs.

	* contrib/pyblosxom/make-blog, contrib/pyblosxom/hardcodedates.py:
	contrib/pyblosxom/getstamps.py: Update version and headers.

2006-08-27  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-configure-highlighting): Prune out any
	nil values before they get to mapconcat.  This fixes a lockup when
	muse-wiki-match-all-project-files is nil.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-match-all-project-files)
	(muse-wiki-ignore-implicit-links-to-current-page)
	(muse-wiki-interwiki-regexp, muse-wiki-interwiki-alist)
	(muse-wiki-resolve-project-page, muse-wiki-handle-interwiki)
	(muse-wiki-publish-small-title-words)
	(muse-wiki-publish-pretty-title): Docfix.
	(muse-wiki-update-local-wikiword-regexp): Rename from
	muse-wiki-update-local-wikiword-regexp.  Set
	muse-wiki-project-file-regexp instead of
	muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp, as suggested by Per Sederberg.  Don't
	take muse-wiki-use-wikiword into account, since this is a
	different concept now.
	(muse-wiki-update-wikiword-regexp): Remove.
	(muse-wiki-wikiword-regexp): In-line the :set function.
	(muse-wiki-handle-wikiword): Use muse-wiki-project-file-regexp.

2006-08-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-surround-text): When looking
	for indented list items, ignore blank lines.

	* lisp/muse-wiki.el (muse-wiki-update-local-wikiword-regexp)
	(muse-wiki-update-interwiki-regexp): Use regexp-opt instead of
	mapconcat.  This should hopefully fix a problem with large amounts
	of files with spaces in their name.  Thanks to Greg Detre for the
	report.

2006-08-24  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-blosxom.el (muse-blosxom-new-entry): Remove the
	numbers from the argument to format-time-string.  This fixes an
	XEmacs bug.  Thanks to Michael Welle for the report and analysis.

2006-08-18  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-file-entries): Since we are
	given a full path, match against the filename as well.  This fixes
	an issue where backup files were being added to the file alist.

	* lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-regexps): Apply a fix
	from muse-html.el.

2006-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (.PHONY): Don't use line continuations.
	(realclean fullclean): Call realclean in subdirs, not distclean.
	(distclean): Don't call realclean, since this would wipe out our
	autoloads file.
	(dist): Use correct path to autoloads file.

	* NEWS: Catch up with the latest changes.

	* experimental/Makefile (.PHONY): Wrap long line.

	* lisp/Makefile (distclean): Do the same thing as "clean", not
	"realclean".

	* lisp/muse-project.el (muse-project-get-applicable-style):
	Indentation tweak.
	(muse-project-ignore-regexp, muse-project-recurse-directory):
	Docfix.
	(muse-project-of-file): Try the ignored files regexp against the
	base filename as well as the entire path.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-this-file): Display message
	if the buffer is not associated with any file, so that we avoid
	errors later on.
	(muse-publish-url-desc): New function taken from muse-publish-url
	that causes a URL description to be transformed.
	(muse-publish-url): Call muse-publish-url-desc on either the
	description or the original URL if it will be used as a
	description.  Accept the original URL as an argument, in case it
	was transformed earlier.
	(muse-publish-insert-url): Pass original URL as an argument.
	(muse-publish-markup-link): Make this somewhat easier to follow.
	Pass original URL as argument.
	(muse-publish-get-style): If the same style is used to publish to
	two different directories, prompt the user for which directory to
	use.
	(muse-publish-markup-header-footer-tags): Sync lisp tag with the
	latest changes.
	(muse-publish-markup-url): Pass original URL as an argument.  This
	fixes the "nil" description for bare URLs that was in 3.02.91.
	Nothing like finding a bug just after completing the announcement
	of a release.

	* lisp/muse.el: Use defalias whenever convenient.
	(muse-version): Set version to 3.02.92 (3.03 RC2).

2006-08-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-finalize-buffer): Since the html
	style does not derive from any other class, return `t' here.
	This, along with the corresponding change to muse-publish.el,
	fixes a problem with the table of contents getting inserted
	multiple times for custom html-based styles.
	(muse-html-markup-strings, muse-xhtml-markup-strings): Use a
	smarter method for table centering that works with XHTML.

	* lisp/muse-latex2png.el Rename all functions to have a
	"muse-latex2png" prefix.  Turn all variables into customizable
	options in the muse-latex2png group.
	(muse-latex2png-img-dest): New option specifying where to place
	the images.
	(muse-latex2png-template): New option containing the template to
	use for the surrounding LaTeX code.
	(muse-latex2png-use-xhtml): New option that toggles strict XHTML
	compliance.
	(muse-latex2png-move2pubdir): Avoid multiple redundant error
	messages when something else goes wrong.  Create the image
	subdirectory if it doesn't exist already -- thanks to Christian
	Straßer for the report.  Expand the filename properly.
	(muse-publish-latex-tag, muse-latex2png): Ditto on error messages
	and filename expansion.
	(muse-latex2png): Use the "muse-latex2png" prefix by default.  Set
	the default directory properly.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-style-run-hooks): Make sure that we
	do not run the same function twice.

2006-08-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-explicit-link): Fix recently
	introduced wrong-type-argument error.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-strings)
	(muse-xhtml-markup-string): Cause table definition that contains
	image to be center-aligned.  This should fix an issue with images
	not being centered when captions are very long.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-table-fields): Trim
	whitespace from fields once we have split them up.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-trim-whitespace): New function that strips
	leading and trailing whitespace from a string.

2006-08-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Update through patch-95.

	* lisp/muse-colors.el (muse-colors-lisp-tag): Use a simpler regexp
	to match the tags.
	(muse-colors-explicit-link): Show images in link descriptions if
	inlined images are enabled.

	* lisp/muse-docbook.el (muse-docbook-markup-strings): Add
	definitions for 'image-with-desc, 'image, and 'image-link.
	(muse-docbook-markup-paragraph): If an inlined image begins a
	paragraph, insert <para> before it.
	(muse-docbook-fixup-images): New function that upper-cases the
	"format" attribute of the <imagedata> tag.
	(muse-docbook-finalize-buffer): Call it.

	* lisp/muse-html.el (muse-html-markup-strings): Publish images
	with descriptions as centered tables, with a centered caption
	underneath.  The resulting look is consistent with the way that
	they are published in the LaTeX style.  Thanks to Jody Klymak for
	the suggestion.
	(muse-xhtml-markup-strings): Ditto, but XHTML apparently has no
	valid way to center a table.
	(muse-html-markup-paragraph): Use class="image" instead of
	"image-link" for paragraphs that start with an embedded image.

	* lisp/muse-latex.el (muse-latex-markup-specials-url): Use
	\textbackslash{} for "\".  Thanks to Jim Ottaway for the
	suggestion.
	(muse-latex-markup-specials-image): New option that enables
	escaping of specials in images.  This was split from the URL
	specials.
	(muse-latex-decide-specials): Handle 'image context.
	(muse-latex-fixup-dquotes): Go to beginning of document, instead
	of relying on caller to do this for us.

	* lisp/muse-publish.el (muse-publish-escape-specials): Document
	'image context.
	(muse-publish-url): Use 'image context for images.  Use 'image
	instead of 'image-link and 'image-link in place of
	'url-with-image.  Separate the image file from its extension so
	that docbook and texinfo can publish images correctly.
	(muse-publish-markup-link): Don't force a description if one is
	not given.  This fixes a bug where images without descriptions
	were being published as 'image-with-desc instead of 'image.

	* lisp/muse-texinfo.el (muse-texinfo-decide-specials): Treat
	images the same as URLs.
	(muse-texinfo-markup-strings): Improve image markup to achieve an
	effect similar to that of the LaTeX publishing style.  Simplify
	'url string.

	* lisp/muse-xml-common.el (muse-xml-decide-specials): Ditto.

	* lisp/muse.el (muse-replace-regexp-in-string): Save match data
	when we have to use the custom version of this function.

	* muse.texi (Images): Explain how to toggle inlining of images and
	give better examples.  Mention captions and that captioned images
	should not be used inside of text paragraphs.
	(Markup Strings): Bring up-to-date with the changes made since
	3.02.
