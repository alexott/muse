;;; Commentary:

;; This module provides a programmable completion facility using
;; "completion functions".  Each completion function is responsible
;; for producing a list of possible completions relevant to the current
;; argument position.
;;
;; To use pcomplete with shell-mode, for example, you will need the
;; following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (load "pcmpl-auto")
;;   (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'pcomplete-shell-setup)
;;
;; Most of the code below simply provides support mechanisms for
;; writing completion functions.  Completion functions themselves are
;; very easy to write.  They have few requirements beyond those of
;; regular Lisp functions.
;;
;; Consider the following example, which will complete against
;; filenames for the first two arguments, and directories for all
;; remaining arguments:
;;
;;   (defun pcomplete/my-command ()
;;     (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-entries))
;;     (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-entries))
;;     (while (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-dirs))))
;;
;; Here are the requirements for completion functions:
;;
;; @ They must be called "pcomplete/MAJOR-MODE/NAME", or
;;   "pcomplete/NAME".  This is how they are looked up, using the NAME
;;   specified in the command argument (the argument in first
;;   position).
;;
;; @ They must be callable with no arguments.
;;
;; @ Their return value is ignored.  If they actually return normally,
;;   it means no completions were available.
;;
;; @ In order to provide completions, they must throw the tag
;;   `pcomplete-completions'.  The value must be the list of possible
;;   completions for the final argument.
;;
;; @ To simplify completion function logic, the tag `pcompleted' may
;;   be thrown with a value of nil in order to abort the function.  It
;;   means that there were no completions available.
;;
;; When a completion function is called, the variable `pcomplete-args'
;; is in scope, and contains all of the arguments specified on the
;; command line.  The variable `pcomplete-last' is the index of the
;; last argument in that list.
;;
;; The variable `pcomplete-index' is used by the completion code to
;; know which argument the completion function is currently examining.
;; It always begins at 1, meaning the first argument after the command
;; name.
;;
;; To facilitate writing completion logic, a special macro,
;; `pcomplete-here', has been provided which does several things:
;;
;;  1. It will throw `pcompleted' (with a value of nil) whenever
;;     `pcomplete-index' exceeds `pcomplete-last'.
;;
;;  2. It will increment `pcomplete-index' if the final argument has
;;     not been reached yet.
;;
;;  3. It will evaluate the form passed to it, and throw the result
;;     using the `pcomplete-completions' tag, if it is called when
;;     `pcomplete-index' is pointing to the final argument.
;;
;; Sometimes a completion function will want to vary the possible
;; completions for an argument based on the previous one.  To
;; facilitate tests like this, the function `pcomplete-test' and
;; `pcomplete-match' are provided.  Called with one argument, they
;; test the value of the previous command argument.  Otherwise, a
;; relative index may be given as an optional second argument, where 0
;; refers to the current argument, 1 the previous, 2 the one before
;; that, etc.  The symbols `first' and `last' specify absolute
;; offsets.
;;
;; Here is an example which will only complete against directories for
;; the second argument if the first argument is also a directory:
;;
;;   (defun pcomplete/example ()
;;      (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-entries))
;;      (if (pcomplete-test 'file-directory-p)
;;          (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-dirs))
;;        (pcomplete-here (pcomplete-entries))))
;;
;; For generating completion lists based on directory contents, see
;; the functions `pcomplete-entries', `pcomplete-dirs',
;; `pcomplete-executables' and `pcomplete-all-entries'.
;;
;; Consult the documentation for `pcomplete-here' for information
;; about its other arguments.

the user wants to see them in a list buffer so that they can know what

If completion is to be done here, evaluate FORM to generate the list
of strings which will be used for completion purposes.  If STUB is a
string, use it as the completion stub instead of the default (which is
the entire text of the current argument).

For an example of when you might want to use STUB: if the current
argument text is 'long-path-name/', you don't want the completions
list display to be cluttered by 'long-path-name/' appearing at the
beginning of every alternative.  Not only does this make things less
intelligle, but it is also inefficient.  Yet, if the completion list
does not begin with this string for every entry, the current argument
won't complete correctly.

The solution is to specify a relative stub.  It allows you to
substitute a different argument from the current argument, almost
always for the sake of efficiency.

If PARING is nil, this argument will be pared against previous
arguments using the function `file-truename' to normalize them.
PARING may be a function, in which case that function is used for
normalization.  If PARING is t, the argument dealt with by this
call will not participate in argument paring.  If it is the
integer 0, all previous arguments that have been seen will be
cleared.

If FORM-ONLY is non-nil, only the result of FORM will be used to
generate the completions list.  This means that the hook
`pcomplete-try-first-hook' will not be run."
