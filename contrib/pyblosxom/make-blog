# This is a sample script that shows how to update the timestamps
# file.  Note that you have to run the getstamps.py program in your
# source directory, and then move the generated timestamps file to the
# directory where your published entries are kept.

# Blog entries in Muse format
SRC_DIR=/stuff/proj/wiki/blog

# Published blog entries
DEST_DIR=$PWD/site/blog

# Path to the getstamps.py script
GETSTAMPS=$PWD/scripts/getstamps.py

# Update timestamps for blog
(cd $SRC_DIR && python $GETSTAMPS && mv timestamps $DEST_DIR/timestamps)
