@chapter Introduction

Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
simplifies the process of writings documents and publishing them to
various output formats.

Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
styles for generating different kinds of output.

This idea is not in any way new. Numerous systems exist -- even one
other for Emacs itself (Bhl Mode). What Muse adds to the picture is a
more modular environment, with a rather simple core, in which "styles"
are derived from to create new styles. Much of Muse's overall
functionality is optional. For example, you can use the publisher
without the major-mode, or the mode without doing any publishing; or if
you don't load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those styles won't be
available.

The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki.el version 2.44. The
code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
functions. The focus in this revision is on the authoring and publishing
aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default behavior (to
be offered again as an optional module). CamelCase words are no longer
special by default.

@section Installing a release

Choose to install a release if you want to minimize risk.  Currently
Muse is in a pre-release stage, so no official releases have been made
yet.

Errors are corrected in development first.  Once fixes are confirmed, a
new release will be made.  User-visible changes will be announced on the
@email{emacs-wiki-discuss@@nongnu.org} mailing list.  @pxref{Getting
Help and Reporting Bugs}.

@cindex Debian package for Muse

Debian users can get Muse via apt-get.  @file{Muse} is available only at
Michael Olson's Debian repository.

@cindex releases, from source

You can also install the source distribution.

@enumerate
@item Download and unpack the latest version from @uref{http://www.mwolson.org/static/dist/muse/} .
@item Edit your @file{~/.emacs}.

@example
;; Add the directories to your load path
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse")
;; Load Muse
(require 'muse)
@end example

@end enumerate

You can download the archive at the following locations:

@itemize
@item Current and past releases: @uref{http://www.mwolson.org/static/dist/muse/}

@section Installing the development version
@cindex development

Choose the development version if you want to live on the bleeding
edge of Muse development or try out new features before release.

@cindex arch revision control system, downloading
The Arch revision control system allows you to retrieve previous
versions and select specific features and bug fixes.

Downloading the modules for the first time:

@enumerate
@item Install arch. Debian: @kbd{apt-get install tla} .  Other distros: see @uref{http://regexps.srparish.net/www/} .
@item Register the archive and download the modules.

@example
# Register the archive
tla register-archive http://www.mwolson.org/archives/2005

# Download Muse into the @file{muse/} subdirectory
tla get mwolson@@gnu.org--2005/muse--main--1.0 muse
@end example

@item Open your @file{~/.emacs} and add the @file{Muse/} directory to your load path.

@example
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse")
@end example

@end enumerate

To list upstream changes not in local copy:

@example
# Change to the source directory you are interested in. Example:
cd muse/

# Display the summary of changes
tla missing --summary
@end example

@cindex updating Muse with Arch

To update to the latest version:

@example
cd muse
tla replay
@end example

You can also obtain the archive at the following locations on the web:

@itemize
@item Browse arch repository: @uref{http://www.mwolson.org/archives/}
@item Latest development snapshot: @uref{http://www.mwolson.org/static/dist/muse-latest.tar.gz}

@chapter Getting Started
@cindex settings

To use Muse, add the directory containing its files to your
@code{load-path} variable, in your @file{.emacs} file.  Then, load in
the authoring mode, and the styles you wish to publish to.  For
example:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path to Muse>")

(require 'muse-mode)     ; load authoring mode

(require 'muse-html)     ; load publishing styles I use
(require 'muse-latex)
(require 'muse-texinfo)
(require 'muse-docbook)
@end lisp

Once loaded, the command @kbd{M-x muse-publish-this-file} will publish
an input document to any available style.  If you enable
@file{muse-mode} within a buffer, by typing @kbd{M-x muse-mode}, this
command will be bound to @kbd{C-c C-t}.

You should also type @kbd{M-x customize-group}, and give the name
@samp{muse}.  Change it to suit your preferences.  Each of the
options has its own documentation.


@node Projects, Keystroke Summary, Getting Started, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter Projects
@cindex projects

Often you will want to publish all the files within a directory to a
particular set of output styles automatically.  To support, Muse
allows for the creations of "projects".  Here is a sample project, to
be defined in your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(require 'muse-project)

(setq muse-project-alist
      '(("website"			; my various writings
         ("~/Pages" :default "index")
         (:base "html" :path "~/public_html")
         (:base "pdf" :path "~/public_html/pdf"))))
@end lisp

The above defines a project named "website", whose files are located
in the directory @file{~/Pages}.  The default page to visit is
@file{index}.  When this project is published, each page will be
output as HTML to the directory @file{~/public_html}, and as PDF to
the directory @file{~/public_html/pdf}.  Within any project page, you
may create a link to other pages using the syntax @samp{[[pagename]]}.

@chapter Markup Rules
@cindex markup

A Muse document uses special, contextual markup rules to determine how
to format the output result.  For example, if a paragraph is indented,
Muse assumes it should be quoted.

There are not too many markup rules, and all of them strive to be as
simple as possible so that you can focus on document creation, rather
than formatting.

@menu
* Paragraphs::                  Paragraphs: centering and quoting.
* Headings::                    Levels of headings.
* Emphasizing Text::            Bold, italicized, and underlined text.
* Footnotes::                   Making notes to be shown at the end.
* Verse::                       Indicating poetic stanzas.

@section Paragraphs
@cindex paragraphs

Paragraphs in Muse must be separated by a blank line.

@cindex paragraphs, centered
@strong{Centered paragraphs and quotations}

A line that begins with six or more columns of whitespace (either tabs
or spaces) indicates a centered paragraph.

@cindex paragraphs, quoted
@cindex quotations
But if a line begins with whitespace, though less than six columns, it
indicates a quoted paragraph.

@cindex examples
@cindex monospace, rendering blocks
@cindex HTML, rendering blocks in monospace
@strong{Literal paragraphs}

The @verb{|<example>|} tag is used for examples, where whitespace should
be preserved, the text rendered in monospace, and any characters special
to the output style escaped.

@cindex literal text
@cindex HTML, inserting a raw block
There is also the @verb{|<literal>|} tag, which causes a marked block to
be entirely left alone.  This can be used for inserting a hand-coded
HTML blocks into HTML output, for example.

@node Headings, Emphasizing Text, Paragraphs, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Headings
@cindex headings

A heading becomes a chapter or section in printed output -- depending on
the style.  To indicate a heading, start a new paragraph with one to
three asterices, followed by a space and the heading title.  Then begin
another paragraph to enter the text for that section.

Only 3 levels of headings will be published as headings.  A fourth level
of headings will be marked up, but displayed as plain text.

@example
* First level

** Second level

*** Third level
@end example

@node Emphasizing Text, Footnotes, Headings, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Emphasizing Text
@cindex emphasizing text
@cindex underlining text
@cindex italicizing text
@cindex verbatim text
@cindex monospace, rendering words

To emphasize text, surround it with certain specially recognized
characters:

@example
*emphasis*
**strong emphasis**
***very strong emphasis***
_underlined_
=verbatim and monospace=
@end example

@cindex WYSIWYG
While editing a Muse document in Muse mode, these forms of emphasis will
be highlighted in a WYSIWYG manner.  Each of these forms may span
multiple lines, with the exception of the verbatim and monospace form.

@node Footnotes, Verse, Emphasizing Text, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Footnotes
@cindex footnotes

A footnote reference is simply a number in square brackets.  To define
the footnote, place this definition at the bottom of your file.
@samp{footnote-mode} can be used to greatly facilitate the creation of
these kinds of footnotes.

Footnotes are defined by the same number in brackets occurring at the
beginning of a line.  Use footnote-mode's @kbd{C-c ! a} command, to very
easily insert footnotes while typing.  Use @kbd{C-x C-x} to return to
the point of insertion.

@node Verse, Lists, Footnotes, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Verse
@cindex verses
@cindex poetry

Poetry requires that whitespace be preserved, but without resorting to
monospace.  To indicate this, use the following markup, reminiscent of
email quotations:

@example
> A line of Emacs verse;
>   forgive its being so terse.
@end example

You can also use the @verb{|<verse>|} tag, if you prefer:

@example
<verse>
A line of Emacs verse;
  forgive its being so terse.
</verse>
@end example

Multiple stanzas may be included in one set of @verb{|<verse>|} tags, as
follows.

@cindex verses, multiple stanzas
@example
<verse>
A line of Emacs verse;
  forgive its being so terse.

This a second stanza:
Something longer should go here,
But the author is out of ideas.
</verse>
@end example

@node Lists, Tables, Verse, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Lists
@cindex lists

Lists are given using special characters at the beginning of a line.
Whitespace must occur before bullets or numbered items, to distinguish
from the possibility of those characters occurring in a real sentence.

@cindex lists, bullets
These are rendered as a bullet list:

@example
  - bullet item one
  - bullet item two
@end example

@cindex lists, enumerated
An enumerated list:

@example
  1. Enum item one
  2. Enum item two
@end example

@cindex lists, definitions
And a definition list:

@example
Term1 ::
  This is a first definition
  And it has two lines;
  no, make that three.

Term2 ::
  This is a second definition
@end example

@node Tables, Links, Lists, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Tables
@cindex tables

@cindex tables, simple
Only very simple tables are supported.  The syntax is:

@example
  Double bars  || Separate header fields

  Single bars   | Separate body fields
  Here are more | body fields

  Triple bars ||| Separate footer fields
@end example

@node Links, Horizontal Rules and Anchors, Tables, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Links
@cindex links

@cindex links, explicit

A hyperlink can reference a URL, or another page within a Muse
project.  In addition, descriptive text can be specified, which should
be displayed rather than the link text in output styles that supports
link descriptions.  The syntax is:

@example
[[link target][link description]]
[[link target without description]]
@end example

Thus, the current maintainer's homepage for Muse can be found
@samp{[[http://www.mwolson.org/projects/MuseMode.html][here]]},
or at @samp{[[http://www.mwolson.org/projects/MuseMode.html]]}.

@cindex images
@cindex links, with images
@strong{Image links}

Links to images may be used in either the target or the description, or
both.  Thus, the following code will publish as a clickable image that
points to @url{http://www.mwolson.org/}.

@example
[[http://www.mwolson.org/][http://www.mwolson.org/static/logos/site-logo.png]]
@end example

@cindex images, local
@cindex images, displaying
If a link to a locally-available image is encountered in the link
description, Muse mode will attempt to display it if your version of
Emacs permits this.  The following example will display correctly and
publish correctly if a @acronym{PNG} file called @file{TestLogo.png}
exists in the @file{../pics/} directory.

@example
[[TestPage][../pics/TestLogo.png]]
@end example

@cindex images, without a description
An image link is not required to have a description.  The link
@samp{[[../myimage.png]]} will display and publish as expected.

@cindex links, raw
@cindex URLs
@cindex Email addresses
@cindex images, inlined
@strong{Bare URLs and Email addresses}

A URL or email address encountered in the input text is published as
a hyperlink if the output style supports it.  If it is an image URL,
it will be inlined if possible.

@node Horizontal Rules and Anchors, Embedded Lisp, Links, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Horizontal Rules and Anchors

@cindex horizontal rules
@cindex dashes
@strong{Horizontal Rules}

Four or more dashes indicate a horizontal rule.  Be sure to put blank
lines around it, or it will be considered part of the proceeding or
following paragraph!

@cindex anchors
@cindex links, with target on same page
@strong{Anchors}

If you begin a line with "#anchor" -- where "anchor" can be any word
that doesn't contain whitespace -- it defines an anchor at that point
into the document.  This point can be referenced using "page#anchor" as
the target in a Muse link.

@node Embedded Lisp, , Horizontal Rules and Anchors, Markup Rules
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Embedded Lisp
@cindex lisp, embedded

Arbitrary kinds of markup can be achieved using the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag,
which is the only Muse tag supported in a style's header and footer
text.  With the @verb{|<lisp>|} tag, you may generated whatever output
text you wish.  The inserted output will get marked up, if the
@verb{|<lisp>|} tag appears within the main text of the document.

@example
<lisp>(concat "This form gets " "inserted")</lisp>
@end example

@cindex lisp, and insert command
Note that you should not use the @code{insert} command within a set of
@verb{|<lisp>|} tags, since the return value from the @verb{|<lisp>|}
tags will be automatically inserted into the document.

@section Deriving styles
@cindex publishing styles, deriving

To create a new style from an existing one, use @code{muse-derive-style}
as follows.  This is a good way to fix something you don't like about a
particular publishing style, or to personalize it.

@example
(muse-derive-style DERIVED-NAME BASE-NAME STYLE-PARAMETERS)
@end example

The derived name is a string defining the new style, such as "my-html".
The base name must identify an existing style, such as "html" -- if you
have loaded @file{muse-html}.  The style parameters are the same as
those used to create a style, except that they override whatever
definitions exist in the base style.  However, some definitions only
partially override.  Those which support partial overriding are:

@table @option

@item :functions
If a markup function is not found in the derived style's function list,
the base style's function list will be queried.

@item :strings
If a markup string is not found in the derived style's string list, the
base style's string list will be queried.

@item :before
If this option is specified, it will be consulted rather than the
corresponding value in the derived style.  This applies to the following
options as well.

@item :before-end

@item :after

John Wiegley started Muse upon realizing that EmacsWiki had some serious
limitations. Around February 2004, he started making "emacs-wiki version
3.00 APLHA", which eventually became known as Muse.

Most of those who frequent the emacs-wiki mailing list continued to use
emacs-wiki, mainly because Planner hasn't been ported over to it.

As of 2004-12-01, Michael Olson became the maintainer of Muse, as per
John Wiegley's request.

the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that

rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

@item
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

@appendixsec Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) @var{yyyy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@var{yy} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@example
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end example

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
